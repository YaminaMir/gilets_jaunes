There is much that is typically Breton about Hervé Berville: his first name, the fact he learned to play the accordion as a child. His grandfather (97) is one of the best-known farmers in the Côtes-d’Armor district of northwest 
.
The 29-year-old deputy in the 
 grew up in a left-leaning, Catholic household, typical of Brittany. At Sunday lunch, the Bervilles and their five children talked about politics and social issues. Hervé won 64 per cent of the vote in the 2017 election because, he says, everyone in the area knows him.
But in the hate-filled atmosphere that has taken hold over three months of demonstrations by yellow vest or 
 protesters, Berville has three times received threatening, racist messages. “The first one said, ‘You should have been killed by a machete blow in Rwanda’,” Berville recounts. He was born a Rwandan Tutsi and was four years old when French soldiers exfiltrated him from an orphanage in Kigali, leading to adoption by his Breton family.
“I received another message that said, ‘We’re going to cut off your head and put it on a pike on the Place de la Concorde’,” Berville continues. He says he had never experienced racism before entering politics. “Your first reaction is stupefaction. How could a person write such horrors? But unfortunately, as a black person, you get used to being called a monkey or a chimpanzee on Facebook and Twitter every time you go on television.”
Berville holds a masters degree in development from the 
. He was working for the French development agency in Mozambique when the far right 
, now called the 
, won the 2014 European elections. Suddenly, it appeared possible that far right leader 
 could become president of France. Berville decided to return to France and get involved in the 2017 campaign.
Also in 2014, Berville was impressed by an article by 
 in the alumni magazine of 
, where he did his undergraduate studies. “It was about thinking as a man of action and acting like a man of thought.”
Berville joined Macron’s youth movement the following year. By April 2016, when Macron founded his party, En Marche, Berville was training Kenyan business people in Nairobi, on behalf of 
. He opened the Kenyan chapter of the party.
Berville resigned from his job with Stanford and returned to France to join Macron’s campaign in November 2016. “My family, friends and colleagues said, ‘Are you crazy?’ They couldn’t believe a guy with no party and no financing could win the election.”  
Berville sees the 
 crisis as an “aftershock” of the “earthquake” of the 2017 elections. “We ended decades of bipartisan politics, of a left-right ping-pong game ... In the old days, you had to work your way up from town councillor to the department to the region, then become a parliamentary assistant... Now people see someone like me, who was just a development economist two years ago, and I’m in the National Assembly. They thought politics was closed to them. Now they say, ‘We’re in a new democratic era’ and they want to seize hold of everything right away.”
The Rwandan genocide, which changed the course of Berville’s life, started 25 years ago on April 7th. He grows more serious, somehow less sure of himself, when I broach the subject. He says he has few memories of 
, and is not certain what he really remembers and what was suggested to him later.
Berville’s birth parents had in fact died before the genocide started. “It was a time of confusion. There were killings, a state of civil war before 1974. Attacks and discrimination against Tutsis were so bad that hundreds of thousands had already fled to neighbouring countries. My remaining relatives preferred to put me in an orphanage so I would be adopted, so that I would have a future.
“I was evacuated by the French army with other orphans during the first week of the genocide in April. I was a Tutsi, so it was very likely I would have been...,” his voice trails off.
He has returned to Rwanda three times and has met his relatives. “The feelings I have are personal. A lot of my family were killed. It is difficult to talk about it. They are my family too. I am fortunate not to have seen the atrocities at first hand, like my aunts, uncles and cousins. I did not have to live through the aftermath and rebuild my life, as they did.”
François Mitterrand’s administration has often been criticised for its role in Rwanda. A parliamentary commission reported in 1998 that France co-operated militarily with the French-speaking Hutu government “against a background of ethnic tensions, massacres and violence”.
Others have gone so far as to accuse France of complicity in the genocide. The alleged motive was to preserve French influence. The then exiled Tutsi leader, 
, an English-speaker, was perceived to be allied with the US and Britain. Kagame has been president of Rwanda for 19 years, and his relations with France have been strained.
Berville has navigated his multiple identities gracefully, but he does not want to be defined by his Rwandan origins. “I am French. I am not Franco-Rwandan.”
Though 25 years have passed, he pleads for more time, “to shed light on everything that happened, to declassify the maximum amount of information. Especially, we must not be trapped by those who say, ‘Everything was the fault of France’ or ‘Everything was the fault of Kagame’. My story is unusual, but I refuse to be the prisoner of two camps who want to simplify history.”

Anti-Semitism is rising sharply across 
, experts have said, as 
 reported a 74 per cent increase in the number of offences against Jews last year and 
 said the number of violent anti-Semitic attacks had surged by more than 60 per cent.
The figures confirm the results of three recent Europe-wide surveys showing Jewish people feel at greater risk, and are experiencing markedly more aggression, amid a generalised increase in racist hate speech and violence in a significantly coarser, more polarised political environment.
France’s interior ministry said this week that recorded incidents of anti-Semitism rose to 541 last year from 311 in 2017, while the German government said offences motivated by hatred of Jews hit a 10-year high of 1,646 in 2018. Physical attacks rose from 37 to 62, leaving 43 people needing medical treatment.
The French president, 
, denounced the trend as “unacceptable”, telling ministers that anti-Semitism in France was “a repudiation of the Republic and its values”. Petra Pau, an MP for Germany’s Die Linke party, said more and more people felt free to “deny the Holocaust and engage in anti-Semitic agitation”.
In the largest ever survey of Jewish anti-Semitism opinion, addressing more than 16,000 Jewish people in 12 European countries, the EU’s Fundamental Rights Agency said at the end of last year that anti-Semitic hate speech, harassment and an increasing fear of being recognised as Jewish were becoming the new normal.
“Decades after the Holocaust, shocking and mounting levels of anti-Semitism continue to plague the EU,” the FRA director, Michael O’Flaherty, said. “Jewish people have a right to live freely, without hate and without fear for their safety.”
The report found 90 per cent of respondents felt anti-Semitism was growing in their country and 30 per cent had been harassed. Over a third avoided going to Jewish events or sites because of safety fears, while the same proportion had considered emigrating. Nearly 80 per cent no longer reported minor incidents because they thought “nothing would change”.
A 28-nation EU Eurobarometer poll released last month revealed a widening gulf between public perceptions of anti-Semitism and those of the Jewish community: while 89 per cent of Jewish people polled said anti-Semitism had “significantly increased” over the past five years, only 36 per cent of the general public felt it had.
Another major recent survey of public attitudes for CNN found more than a fifth of the 7,000 people polled in seven countries believed Jewish people have too much influence in finance and politics, while 34 per cent felt they knew little or nothing about the Holocaust - even if 32 per cent still thought Jews exploited it to “advance their position”.
A combination of factors seem to be to blame. In the past two decades, anti-Semitic attacks in Europe have generally peaked in line with tensions in the Middle East. “They were essentially the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, imported,” said Marc Knobel, a historian at the Crif umbrella group for France’s Jewish organisations. “Rather than attacking Israelis, people went for Jews.”
But since early last year, said Frederic Potier of the French government’s anti-racism and anti-Semitism body Dilcrah, more traditional forms of anti-Semitism have re-emerged. “We are witnessing the resurgence of a virulent, far-right identity politics that does not hesitate to put its beliefs into action,” Potier told Le Monde.
Knobel said the taboos around anti-Semitism “had all but disappeared”, pointing to the re-emergence of longstanding anti-Semitic tropes involving Jews and money. In France, for example, he told Liberation, the fact that Macron previously worked for the 
 merchant bank had “fuelled a load of rumours”.
Experts describe a “perfect storm” for anti-Semitic attacks combining the increasing influence of far-right groups and governments; the rise of conspiracy theories about a supposed global Zionist plot (and the scale on which they circulate on social media); and a general increase in the violence of public discourse.
Although the most recent rise in anti-Semitic incidents in France began before the emergence of the anti-establishment gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement, some have occurred during their weekly Saturday demonstrations. A recent poll suggested nearly half of yellow vest protesters believed in a “Zionist plot”.
Alternative fur Deutschland’s (AfD) Alexander Gauland described the Holocaust as a “small bird dropping in over 1,000 years of successful German history”. AfD party has been widely accused of fomenting hate against refugees, Muslims and Jews.
A large influx of mostly Muslim refugees and migrants to Germany from 2015 has also led to a rise in anti-Semitic attacks by migrants from Arab states, although figures show an overwhelming majority of violence against Jews is perpetrated by far-right supporters. “Militant rightwing extremists are now openly calling for the desecration of Jewish institutions and attacks against Jewish people,” Pau said.
Some governments, particularly in eastern Europe, stand accused of at best tolerating racism and anti-Semitism, and at worst encouraging it. Hungary’s far-right Fidesz party, led by prime minister Viktor Orban, has run vitriolic campaigns against migrants and demonising George Soros, the Hungarian-born Jewish financier.
In CNN’s recent survey, 42 per cent of Hungarians polled said they thought Jews held too much sway over the worlds of finance and international affairs. While an average of one in 10 Europeans said they personally had an “unfavourable attitude” to Jews, the figure rose to nearly 15 per cent in 
 and 19 per cent in 
. 
The European council late last year adopted a declaration urging all EU members to increase their efforts to “prevent and combat all forms of anti-Semitism”, as well as “assure the security of Jewish communities, institutions and citizens”.
But the bloc’s Fundamental Rights Agency said a “wave” of anti-Jewish hate crime was threatening “the very values on which the union was built”.

French president Emmanuel Macron will describe 
 as a wake-up call in a speech this month when he will say Europe must be more assertive in the face of rival world powers, according to sources close to the Élysée Palace.
His words are intended as a “warning shot” for a continent unable to project power and defend itself, say aides. They describe the speech as Mr Macron’s most important since he urged fundamental reform of the European Union in 2017.
“This is a critical time,” said a source close to President Macron. “If we Europeans don’t want to have other Brexits and become trapped in a naive defence of status quo, we have to wake up.”
Mr Macron’s speech coincides with rising tensions in the West, which has been shaken by US president Donald Trump’s “America First” policies and Britain’s departure from the EU. A more assertive China and Russia also pose significant challenges.
Although the French president will use Brexit as the main impetus for his speech, the aim is not to offer an initiative to unblock the negotiating stalemate between London and Brussels, said the source.
“He won’t comment on the negotiation, or offer some kind of ‘Macron plan’ to fix the problem. The idea is to draw the lessons from Brexit,” said the source.
In Mr Macron’s view, Brexit is part of the same phenomenon that brought Trump to power and sparked the yellow-vest movement in France: a fear of losing out from globalisation, territorial inequalities and rising contempt for the establishment.
The French president will focus on championing a “Europe that protects” in the May 26th European election. And he will try to convince voters with plans aimed at reforming Europe’s trade, competition, digital and climate policies.
The speech will also seek to convince his European counterparts, who have watered down many of his 2017 proposals, to start thinking of the EU as a tougher geopolitical player in a ruthless world.
“The EU has done the internal regulation rather well, built a nice, peaceful area, with benign trade and regulated competition. But Europe hasn’t understood how to carry itself in a brutal world,” said the source 
Meanwhile, Gibraltar’s leader has said an incursion into British waters by a Spanish warship at the weekend was a quixotic attempt at intimidation. But he said the people of Gibraltar would stand up to bullies before and after Brexit on March 29th.
“Anyone who believes in the rules-based international legal order will have been shocked by the cavalier and quixotic actions of the Spanish military vessel at the weekend,” said Gibraltar chief minister Fabian Picardo.
“This childish behaviour is unsatisfactory whether it is errant or directed from above,” said Mr Picardo. “The people of Gibraltar won’t be bullied now or after the 29th of March.”
Mr Picardo said the Spanish vessel sailed through Gibraltar’s waters with her weapons uncovered. – Reuters

In just a few weeks, the yellow hi-vis vest has become such a potent political symbol that one risks being mistaken for a supporter of the rebellious 
when cycling in Paris.
The 
are a grass-roots revolt against high fuel prices, and they threaten to paralyse 
 on Saturday.
The cause of the price hikes are “eco taxes” meant to dissuade the French from using cars. “We choose to tax pollution and harmful products rather than workers,” budget minister Gérald Darmanin explains. Yet the fuel taxes penalise the poor disproportionately.
In the hope of deflating the protests, prime minister Édouard Philippe on Wednesday announced €500 million of compensatory measures, including a €5,000 bonus for low-income earners who trade in polluting cars for a hybrid model.  
The 
have organised at least 630 protests nationwide via the 
 website, designed by an 18-year-old student. Some call for go-slows on highways. Others want to block roads, which is punishable by two years in prison and a €4,500 fine. Interior minister 
 says no “total blockage” will be tolerated.
But several police unions have expressed sympathy, and promised not to punish petty or “middle-size” offences “out of solidarity with the citizens”.
The movement has found an unlikely symbol in 
, a 51-year-old accordion player, hypnotist and spiritual medium from Brittany who on October 18th posted a video message hectoring President 
 for “persecuting drivers”.
Mouraud’s video went viral, and has been viewed by more than six million people. “I have a thing or two to tell you,” she starts out. The stream of accusations includes the price of fuel, the “hunt” for diesel vehicles, the “forest” of radars, the number of traffic tickets, the possibility tolls may be charged to enter large towns and rumours of mandatory bicycle registration.
“What are you doing with the dough, apart from changing the china at the Élysée and building a swimming pool?” Mouraud asks Macron.
A senior adviser to Macron spoke scathingly of “this Madame Mouraud who generates spirits from under her fingernails”. He expressed consternation that a video “stuffed with lies” has reached such a wide audience, saying: “I have the feeling that our democracy is also at stake.”
Yet the Élysée “is absolutely not condescending towards this movement”, the adviser continued. “We don’t underestimate its amplitude. Our vigilance is total, even if the signals are blurred.”
The rise of the 
coincides with Macron’s record low 26 per cent approval rating. A poll published by Ifop on November 14th indicates two-thirds of French people expect a “social explosion” in coming months.
Macron has tried to counter the disillusionment by spending the first week of November on the road in northeastern France and by repeated appeals to reason. In a television interview given on the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier on Wednesday night, he said he wants to govern “in a different manner” in future. The French want respect, protection and solutions, “not declarations”, Macron said. He promised that henceforward, his administration will spend much more time “on the ground”.  
The senior adviser noted that Macron’s reforms, for example of the pension system, unemployment insurance and professional training, are not contested. “What the 
movement captures is an irritation over purchasing power, fuel prices ... It is possible that we paid too much attention to structural reforms and not enough to the daily life of the French.”
, a professor at Sciences Po and one of France’s leading political scientists, notes that Macron’s popularity collapsed in three stages. In May 2017, the month of his election, Macron had a 62 per cent approval rating. He fell 17 percentage points the first summer, when the 
decided that Macron represented the rich, not them.
In late 2017 and early 2018, older people deserted Macron because he increased their social contributions and decided pensions would no longer be inflation-indexed. Last summer he began to lose his core middle-class supporters, because of the misconduct of his bodyguard, 
, and several statements that were deemed arrogant or condescending.
Perrineau said strident, systematic criticism of Macron is often “not deserved” but that the president nonetheless “asks for it” by carelessly offending voters.
The government has accused the far right of trying to exploit the 
. Several officials from Marine Le Pen’s 
 and 
 Aignan’s movement are helping to mobilise for Saturday’s protests, but some mainstream parties also want to curry favour with the demonstrators.
Though media portray Le Pen as a spent force, “her electorate is still there”, says Perrineau. A recent poll showed the RN leads voting intentions for the European parliamentary election next May, at 21 per cent to 19 per cent for Macron’s La République en Marche.

A motorist accidentally hit and killed a protester taking part in a campaign of road blockades across 
 on Saturday, as thousands gathered on motorways in a backlash against higher fuel taxes.
The demonstrators, part of a grassroots movement dubbed the “yellow vests”, caused logjams on highways and blocked roundabouts as they railed against the fuel tax hikes introduced by French President 
.
The protests, largely orchestrated on social media and which aimed to prevent road access to some fuel depots and airports, have also drawn broader support from some voters dissatisfied with Macron’s economic reforms and his governing style.
At a blockade on a road in the southeastern department of 
, a driver panicked when protesters surrounded her car and she accelerated, hitting and killing a woman demonstrator, French Interior Minister 
 said in televised comments.
Sixteen people were lightly injured in other accidents across the country, and a person run over by a car in northern France was in a critical state, according to the interior ministry, which estimated some 50,000 demonstrators were participating in Saturday’s protests.
Some incidents occurred as drivers not taking part tried to get around the blockades, police sources said.
Protesters gathered at sensitive flashpoints including the entry to a tunnel under the Mont-Blanc mountain in the Alps, and traffic was backed up on several highways.
Demonstrators were also on the march in cities, including 
 where around 100 people, wearing the high visibility vests drivers keep in their cars, blocked roads around its port.
The backlash is the latest confrontation between Macron and voters, mostly based in the countryside and provincial towns and cities, who view the former investment banker as the representative of a remote urban elite.
During his 18 months in power, Macron (40) has often pushed through reforms, including an overhaul of indebted state rail operator 
, in the face of opposition from labour unions.
But the “yellow vest” movement has snowballed swiftly over the past month, catching Macron and even opposition parties off guard. It has already prompted a rare concession from the government, which announced last Wednesday fresh funds to help motorists on the lowest incomes.
The higher fuel taxes were approved in late 2017 but started to bite as oil prices surged in October, even though they have since eased off somewhat.
The diesel tax increases are designed to encourage drivers to switch to more environmentally-friendly cars.

Shouts of “Macron resign!” and “Macron get lost!” punctuated the booms from tear gas and water cannons on the Champs-Élysées on Saturday, as French police forced protesters from the “Yellow Vests” movement away from the presidential offices in the Élysée Palace.
Welling up rapidly from rural and forgotten 
, this broad-based, citizen-driven movement is among the most serious challenges yet to President Emmanuel Macron’s pro-business government, say analysts, political opponents and even many of Macron’s supporters.
On Saturday, thousands of the “gilets jaunes”, or Yellow Vests, named for the fluorescent road-safety vests that all French drivers must carry in their vehicles, converged on Paris for a second weekend to protest a rise in fuel taxes and to express general discontent with the fiscal burden in one of the most highly taxed states in Europe, where taxes represent over 45 percent of GDP.
The numbers had dropped sharply from the preceding week’s several hundred thousand protesters; police estimated there were about 8,000 in Paris and more than 80,000 across the country on Saturday.
Clouds of gas and smoke rolled up the Champs-Élysées all afternoon as police battled militant members of the crowd wielding paving stones; the grassroots protesters insisted they were unconnected with their movement.
“We’re just fed up. It seems like to us that the government is only working to maintain its own privileges,” said Mathieu Styrna, one of the thousands marching. A contractor, he said he had been forced to drive hundreds of miles a week for work and could no longer afford his gas bills.
It is the movement’s amorphousness that makes it new, powerful and potentially dangerous for Macron, analysts say. “The government parties didn’t understand that their tax policies would wind up producing this,” said Dominique Reynie, a political scientist at Sciences Po, saying the tax burden had grown by about €25 billion every year between 2002 and 2017.
No high-ranking official has met with any of the self-designated spokespeople for the movement who have been appearing on French television all week. There have been a few small fiscal gestures – promises of checks and rebates – but these were dismissed by Saturday’s protesters as irrelevant to their daily struggle.
“It’s going to trigger a civil war and me, like most other citizens, we’re all ready,” said 
, a 21-year-old protester from 
.
Mr Macron has insisted that the fuel tax rises are a necessary pain to reduce France’s dependence on fossil fuels and fund renewable energy investments, which is a cornerstone of his reforms of the nation. He will defend fresh plans to make the “energy transition” easier on Tuesday.

 recalled its ambassador to Rome on Thursday, for the first time since 
 declared war on France in 1940. The move signifies a serious rupture, unprecedented in postwar relations between European powers and only a step short of breaking diplomatic ties.
Agnès Von Der Mühll, the spokeswoman for the French foreign ministry, announced the recall of ambassador 
 in a short statement.
“France has for several months been the object of repeated accusations, of baseless attacks, of outrageous declarations that everyone knows and bears in mind,” Ms Von Der Muhll said. In a remark so vulgar that it was little reported in France, the Italian undersecretary for foreign affairs, 
, recently said French president 
 “suffers from the syndrome of the small penis”.
Mr Di Stefano is part of the populist 
 (M5S) whose leader, 
, is a deputy prime minister and minister for labour.
, the head of the far right League, interior minister and the strongman in the Italian government, said recently that he felt sorry for “millions of men and women in France who live with a very bad government and a very bad president of the republic”.
For high-ranking officials from a founding member of the EU to support calls for the resignation of the president of a fellow founding member is also unprecedented.
Mr Salvini attempted to ease tensions after the ambassador’s recall on Thursday. He told the 
: “I am ready to turn the page in our relations with France, for the good of our people and I would be happy to meet Macron. But France must stop turning back migrants at the border.”
On Tuesday, Mr Di Maio met representatives of the rebellious “yellow vests” movement in the French town of Montargis. He had urged them to “hang in there” last month.
Mr Di Maio posted a photograph of himself with 
 leaders on Instagram, with the caption, “The winds of change have crossed the Alps. I repeat: the winds of change have crossed the Alps.”
Mr Di Maio called the photograph “a souvenir of a beautiful meeting, the first of a series, during which we talked about our countries, social rights, the environment and direct democracy”.
Christophe Chalençon, a 
 leader who met Mr Di Maio, and who is launching a list for the May 26th European election, said he wanted “to clarify the relations between 
 and the League” because it was “out of the question for us to draw closer to the extreme right”. Mr Chalençon was satisfied that M5S was “a popular, centre left-wing movement”.
The meeting “gave international value to our action,” Mr Chalençon continued. Mr Di Maio has invited the French protesters to Rome.
Mr Salvini and Mr Di Maio both seek potential allies in the EU parliament. It was inadmissible that discord between the two countries “be exploited for electoral reasons”, the French foreign ministry said. Alluding to Mr Di Maio’s trip to Montargis, it added: “The most recent interference constitutes an additional and unacceptable provocation. It violates the respect that is due to democratic choices, made by a friendly, allied country. It violates the respect that democratically and freely elected governments owe to each other. The European election campaign cannot justify the absence of respect for other peoples or their democracy. ”
The situation has worsened dramatically since Mr Salvini and Mr Di Maio came to power last June, but the deterioration in Franco-Italian relations started eight years ago, with the French intervention in Libya, and was aggravated by France’s response to migrants landing on Italian beaches.

French security forces will deploy armoured vehicles in Paris on Saturday in anticipation of more violence and rioting by radical groups on the fringes of the 
 (yellow vests) movement.
A government official said 89,000 police and gendarmes would be mobilised across the country, 8,000 of them in the French capital, alongside a dozen VBRG armoured vehicles.
“We are facing people who are not there to demonstrate, but are there to smash things up and we want to make sure we’re not leaving them to do what they want,” prime minister Édouard Philippe said in an attempt to justify the use of the VBRG, which are capable of firing tear-gas grenades and clearing barricades and are rarely used in city areas.
Paris went into lockdown on Friday, as the city prepared for a fourth weekend of protests. There was a sense of impending attack in the city centre as banks, shops, restaurants and businesses rushed to board up their premises to protect windows from looters.
At Place de la Bastille, which is currently undergoing pedestrianisation, workers cleared away metal and concrete barriers and carried off anything that could be thrown. The windows of the Banque de 
 were being hurriedly boarded up on Friday morning. Staff at the Bastille Opéra were reported to have locked the orchestra’s instruments somewhere safe fearing an assault on the building.
Parisiens, even those far from the Champs-Élysées, Arc de Triomphe and Place de la Concorde – the scenes of violent clashes in previous weeks – were advised not to leave dustbins on the streets for fear they could be set alight.
The preparations come after the city saw the worst street unrest in 50 years last Saturday as groups of protesters confronted riot police, torched vehicles and looted shops.
The Eiffel Tower and Louvre museum will remain closed on Saturday. In 
, a dozen public buildings will be closed. Six League 1 football matches have been cancelled.
The 
 movement started as a protest against a proposed rise in diesel and petrol tax, and takes its name from the yellow high-vis jackets that all motorists must by law carry in their cars. It quickly expanded into a wider anti-government movement made up of moderate factions calling for higher living standards, who have protested peacefully, and a violent fringe.
The protesters’ anger is directed at a president, 
, accused of being aloof and out of touch and a government seen to represent a political elite that has no idea how l
 – the less well-off – live.
Outside of the capital, tax offices have been boarded up, though the association of rural mayors has asked local councillors to keep town halls open to allow “each citizen to verbally express their anger”.
Ministers have repeated calls for calm and requested that protesters stay away from the capital as have union leaders, opposition parties and Roman Catholic clergy.
Hours before protesters were due to descend on the French capital, French media reported that Mr Macron had refused a demand to meet “moderate” gilets jaunes at the Elysée.
, an unofficial spokesman, said representatives of the movement had asked to see the president because “insurrection is at the gates of France and we don’t want any deaths this weekend”. The Elysée responded that the prime minister’s door “remained open”.
Mr Macron has been silent since Wednesday evening when he performed a surprising volte-face on the fuel tax, announcing it was being cancelled, just hours after Mr Philippe had told the National Assembly it was being frozen and “might” be abandoned.
French media quoted officials saying the president was anxious not to inflame the situation by addressing the country before Saturday’s demonstrations. He is expected to give a televised address at the beginning of next week.
Efforts to prepare for what 
 demonstrators are calling Act IV of their action is hampered by the grassroots movement having no formal organisation or leadership, posing an unique challenge to the French authorities.
Speaking to 
 protesters, a recurring theme is the feeling their leaders hold them in contempt. Attempts by the Elysée and government to calm the volatile crisis, including dropping the fuel tax, and pledges to review the complex tax system, have done little to appease protesters.
The insurrection is being further fuelled on social media websites by conspiracy theories and fake news, including widely spread but false claims that Mr Macron is “selling France” to the 
, 
 or other international organisations planning to let millions of migrants take over France. The reports have been viewed several million times.
The French government has also deployed police to deal with high school student protests. A video showing police forcing students to kneel in rows with their arms behind their backs has caused shock and further criticism of the government.
Education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said the images had to be seen in the context of police responding to student violence. “There are shocking images because we are in a climate of exceptional violence,” Mr Blanquer said. – Guardian

French president Emmanuel Macron is set to make a major announcement in the coming week after further violence from “yellow vest” protesters, the government said on Sunday.
Anti-government protesters faced off with French riot police in Paris on Saturday, hurling projectiles, torching cars and vandalising shops and restaurants in a fourth weekend of unrest that has shaken Mr Macron’s authority.
The president is facing mounting criticism for not appearing in public in over a week as violence worsened. His last major address to the nation was on November 27th, when he said he would not be bounced into changing policy by “thugs”.
“The President of the Republic will of course make important announcements,” government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said on LCI television on Sunday. He gave no other details.
“However, not all the problems of the ‘yellow vest’ protesters will be solved by waving a magic wand,” Mr Griveaux said.
Following last week’s riots, the government offered a string of concessions to try and soothe public anger, scrapping fuel increases planned for January and freezing energy prices in the first major U-turn of Mr Macron’s presidency.
However, mindful of France’s deficit and not wanting to flout EU rules, the president has scant wriggle room for more concessions.

Workers in Paris again cleared streets of glass and towed away burnt-out cars on Sunday after further violent protests as the government announced President Emmanuel Macron would address the nation early in the coming week.
On Saturday, anti-government protesters wrecked havoc in the city for the fourth Saturday in a row, hurling projectiles, torching cars and vandalising shops and restaurants.
Across the city, banks and shops had boarded up storefronts smashed by protesters and walls and windows were covered in anti-Macron slogans.
“You won’t make it past Christmas, Emmanuel,” read the graffiti on a boarded-up shop near the Champs-Élysées boulevard.
Mr Macron is facing mounting criticism for not speaking in public in more than a week as violence worsened.
“This chaos has to end,” said Andre Juillard, a doctor, as he stood in line with other Parisians at a bakery near the Eiffel Tower, which reopened along with other monuments and museums after closing for security reasons on Saturday.
Gregory Caray, owner of two furniture shops in the heart of Paris, said he was relieved to see that his shop had not been vandalised, but the protective wooden boards over its windows were plastered with graffiti.
““You can understand the yellow vests movement. But this is completely unacceptable. It has been three weekends in a row now. Look around you, everything is broken, damaged. All the shops had to close and spend money to shut everything up, and it happens every week,” he told Reuters.
Named after the fluorescent safety vests that French motorists must carry, the “yellow vest” protests erupted out of nowhere on November 17th, when nearly 300,000 demonstrators nationwide took to the streets to denounce high living costs and Mr Macron’s liberal economic reforms.
The government this week cancelled a planned rise in taxes on petrol and diesel in a bid to defuse the situation but the protests have morphed into a broader anti-Macron rebellion.
In the centre of Place de la Republique a banner hanging from the bronze statue of Marianne, symbol of the French republic, read: “Give back the money”.

Several police vehicles were parked on the corner below my apartment building. Cops checked identity papers of pedestrians in my neighbourhood, where numerous government ministries are located. The place du Palais Bourbon, seat of the 
, was enclosed in a giant cage.
I encountered three gilets jaunes wearing hi-visibility security vests in the rue Saint Dominique. They had fled the Champs-Élysées, at most a mile away, choking with tear gas. The three friends, Erwan, Joelle and Cédric, had taken a train at Provins, in the Aube department of eastern 
, at 5.30am to join the Paris demonstration. They are typical of the unstructured protest movement.
When the friends arrived at the Gare de l’Est they were stopped at a police checkpoint just outside the station and their ski goggles, which they had brought to protect themselves from tear gas, were confiscated. The metro was closed so they walked 45 minutes to reach the Champs-Élysées.
It was peaceful “until around 10.15, when they started firing tear gas”, said Joelle (31), a stay-at-home mother of two. “It burns. It makes you cry. Your eyes close on their own and you can’t see anything at all for a few seconds,” said Erwan. “Watch which way the wind is blowing,” Joelle advised me, since I was heading towards the demonstration. “Run in the opposite direction of the wind, because the wind brings the tear gas towards you. I earn the Smic (minimum wage) of €1,200 per month,” said Erwan.
The condition of his teeth reminded me that former president François Hollande allegedly called the poor les sans dents. As we talked on the pavement, cars drove by hooting their horns, to show solidarity with the yellow vests. Though support for the movement has faltered somewhat since riots broke out on the last two Saturdays, polls still show that more than 70 per cent of the population agree with their demands for lower taxes and higher living standards. All the cars hooted except a Porsche, I noted.
“We’re going to stick them with the wealth tax again!” said Erwan. President 
 cancelled the wealth tax on capital, but not property, last year. Its re-establishment is a new demand by the yellow vests, since Macron annulled a hated rise on carbon tax on fuel. The three friends from eastern France demonstrated in their own department the first two weeks, then decided to come to Paris.
“We have to show our strength. We have to show that the countryside is coming to Paris,” said Erwan. As far as he was concerned, the struggle was only “for purchasing power and for less taxes”. A worker in a door and window factory, he pays no income tax. But between “rent, electricity, insurance, petrol and filling the fridge”, his salary runs out by the third week of the month.
President Macron is the target of protesters “because he’s the one in power. Because he gives presents to the rich and because he doesn’t want to answer to us,” said Erwan.
“Why aren’t there any rich people in the demonstrations?” asked Joelle. There was an element of class warfare to the protests, she admitted. “The rich people look down on us.” But Erwan interjected: “We don’t hate rich people. It’s the injustice we hate, the difference between rich and poor.”
Cédric (28) had just completed a six-month contract in a tyre factory, where he earned €1,500 per month. “We’re waiting to see what comes next,” he said. “We want higher salaries, lower-priced petrol and for them to tax rich people. They’ve just raised the salaries for the CRS (riot police), so they can raise everybody else’s.”
If Macron would resign, said Erwan, “that would be Utopia”. The three friends said the violence that marked the last two marches, on December 1st and 8th, was unfortunate but necessary. “I came to demonstrate, not to fight,” said Joelle. “But there has to be breakage. Otherwise no one pays attention.”
Many of the skirmishes between police and rioters took place in side streets off the Champs-Élysées. It was strange to see police and yellow vests mingling in calm parts of the city, then suddenly confronting each other in riot zones. A few dozen yellow vests rested around a dry fountain on the place Francois 1er, near the Champs-Élysée. I struck up a conversation with an agitated young man holding ski goggles who did not want to give his name or profession.
He kept glancing at the gendarmes advancing into the intersection a few dozen metres away. The young man’s main demand was an RIC – a referendum on citizen’s initiative. A few minutes later, I would see a protester in the middle of the Champs-Élysée brandishing a banner with the initials RIC. He spewed hatred against Macron who, he said “venerates Rothschild (bank) more than his own father”.
The men resting on the edge of the fountain joined in. “If you steal three apples you go to prison. Castaner (the interior minister) should be in prison,” said one. “It’s illegal for me to beat my wife or spank my children,” said another. “But the police strike us with truncheons. They fire grenades at old age pensionsers.”
“I hope you’re not a corrupt media like the French,” said the first young man. “They claim we are only a few tens of thousands. We are millions.”
The gendarmes in the intersection formed a compact circle, with their shields in front of them. Black smoke from a burning car billowed from a side street. A helicopter clattered overhead. A police motorcade with flashing blue lights inched towards the Rond Point des Champs-Élysées, protected by the gendarmes. We followed the police vans down the avenue Montaigne, beneath white Christmas fairy lights.
“The people want Dior,” stated graffiti scrawled on plywood covering the haute couture boutique’s windows. To my right at the roundabout, dozens of gendarmerie and police vans were lined up, as if ready to charge up the avenue des Champs-Élysée. They were in fact protecting the approaches to the Élysée Palace. The yellow vests were grouped to the left, perhaps 100m up the avenue, staring down the security forces opposite.
A line of blue lights at the top of the avenue, in front of the Arc de Triomphe, marked the other frontline, with the yellow vests wedged between. Police repeatedly fired what the yellow vests called “noise bombs”.
There were other detonations and a cloud of tear gas hovered above the protesters. “The noise bombs make as many decibels as a 747 taking off,” said Benoit (31) a management consultant who had returned home from London to take part in the protests. “They can make you permanently deaf.”
Benoit also accused the media of lying. “Look at the yellow vests!” he exclaimed. “There are at least 50,000 of them. We are gaining ground against the fascist forces. We’re holding a third of the Champs-Élysées now . . . The gendarmes are military. They are part of the army. Their role is to protect the people, not the corrupt government . . . This is the biggest military deployment in France since May ’68 . . . We’re fed this line about being the country of human rights. Why don’t they give us some human rights?”
Benoit pulled his ski mask on before jogging back towards the yellow vests. “I have to go join my friends now,” he said. “My rucksack is full of bandages.”

Special counsel 
 has concluded that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign team and 
 in the 2016 presidential election, US attorney general William Barr has said in a letter to 
.
The four-page letter sent to senior congressional figures on Sunday afternoon says that Mr Mueller’s report, which was submitted to the department of justice on Friday, found no collusion.
“The special counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or co-ordinated with the Russian government,” the letter states.
“The evidence ‘does not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference’,” the letter says, quoting directly from Mr Mueller’s report.
The findings come after a 22-month investigation by Mr Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by president 
.
On the issue of obstruction of justice, Mr Barr’s letter is more ambivalent. Noting that Mr Mueller decided not to make a “traditional prosecutorial judgment” on the issue of obstruction of justice, it adds: “While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”
The letter states that the special counsel’s decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions “leaves it to the attorney general to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime”.
No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
The Department of Justice “determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgement.”
Mr Barr writes that, together with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, he has concluded that “the evidence developed during the special counsel investigation is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offence”.
Following the release of the letter, US president Donald Trump tweeted that he had been completely exonerated by Mr Mueller of collusion or obstruction of justice.
“It’s a shame that our country had to go through this,” Mr Trump later told reporters before boarding Air Force One to return to Washington from Florida. “This was an illegal takedown that failed. And hopefully, somebody’s going to be looking at the other side.”
However, Jerry Nadler, the head of the judiciary committee in the House of Representatives, noted that the special counsel “clearly and explicitly is not exonerating the president.
“We must hear from AG Barr about his decision-making and see all the underlying evidence for the American people to know all the facts.”
Mr Nadler said he will be calling Mr Barr to testify “in light of the very concerning discrepancies” in the attorney general’s summary of the report.
But Republicans said the letter exonerated the president. Senator Lindsey Graham said it was a “bad day for those hoping the Mueller investigation would take president Trump down . . . Now it is time to move on, govern the country, and get ready to combat Russia and other foreign actors ahead of 2020.”
A senior department of justice official said she did not know how long it would take Mr Barr to decide which portions of Mr Mueller’s report to make public.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Sunday the findings were a “total and complete exoneration of the president of the United States”.
Meanwhile, Mr Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani responded to the report by saying: “It’s better than I expected.”
US House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said that the full report should be made public.
“The fact that special counsel Mueller’s report does not exonerate the president on a charge as serious as obstruction of justice demonstrates how urgent it is that the full report and underlying documentation be made public without any further delay,” Ms Pelosi and Mr Schumer said in a joint statement.

Thousands of yellow vests gravitated towards the Champs-Élysées and the Arc de Triomphe on Saturday morning, with much of the city quiet as a ghost town. In a pre-ordained ritual, shops that were perfectly safe the day before and the day after had to be protected with iron shutters or plywood fronting. Security forces organised the area like a football fan zone, with searches at entry points. When demonstrators and rioters were driven out by tear gas, noise grenades and rubber bullets, they regrouped elsewhere in the city in the style of flash mobs.
The first yellow vests I encountered had left home in eastern 
 at 5.30am “to show the countryside is coming to Paris”. They hoped to regroup at the Place de la République and were typical of the most disadvantaged protesters. Their demands were economic, not political.
Cars drove by hooting horns, to show solidarity, all except a Porsche, I noted. “We’re going to stick them with the wealth tax again!” said Erwan (33), a minimum-wage factory worker.
“Why aren’t there any rich people in the demonstrations?” asked Joelle (31), a stay-at-home mother. “The rich people look down on us.”
“We don’t hate rich people,” Erwan interjected. “It’s the injustice we hate, the difference between rich and poor.”
The violence that marked the last two marches, on December 1st and 8th, was unfortunate but necessary, Joelle said. “There has to be breakage. Otherwise no one pays attention.”
The next two groups, interviewed at random, were university-educated and politically motivated. Though they voted far-right and far-left in last year’s elections, they were united in hatred of the European Union.
“
 is the symbol of all our problems,” said Jean-Luc Pujo (52), the president of a tiny movement called 
. Pujo too had fled the tear gas. He wore a blue, white and red ribbon pinned to his chest.
Our conversation was interrupted by a loud boom from the direction of the Arc de Triomphe, a “noise bomb” intended to deafen and scatter demonstrators. “We are living through the same phenomenon as the US electorate who brought Trump to power,” Pujo continued. “It’s about reaffirming the sovereignty of the people.”
The day was rich in paradoxes. Pujo is a legal expert who defends the state in court cases, but he demands the dissolution of the 
.
Pierre, a 26-year-old waiter and law student at the Sorbonne draped in a tricolour flag, told me he wants to become a police officer. But he was fleeing riot police, I noted. “They’re just doing their job,” Pierre replied. He was the first of several demonstrators to tell me that he wants a “popular referendum” or “citizen’s referendum” known as an RIP or RIC.
“This anger has been brewing 30 or 40 years,” Pierre said. “Macron is politically dead.”
I found an open cafe, Le Recrutement, packed with yellow vests. The head waiter grumbled over the movement in general and those who don’t pay their tab in particular. “Hotel occupancy is down 40 per cent, our turnover 75 per cent. I want to move to New York,” he said.
I found more yellow vests, who had managed to smuggle gas masks and goggles into the restricted zone, on the Place François 1er. They had the fit, angry look of 
 or anarchist vandals. Black smoke billowed from a burning car. A helicopter flew low overhead.
A young man who refused to tell me anything about himself said he wanted a “citizen’s referendum”. He doesn’t vote, he said, quoting the late comedian Coluche: “If voting could change things, it would have been banned a long time ago.”
Newspapers reported at the weekend that French intelligence is investigating allegations of Russian intervention through social media in the French crisis.
“On Monday, 
 is going to put France under UN rule,” the agitated young man with the gas mask told me, echoing a rumour spread by a Facebook page belonging to a yellow vest known as “Fly Rider”. “The Rothschilds [bankers] own the UN and Macron venerates them more than his own father, so he’ll sign the pact.”
The Marrakesh pact is in fact a non-binding commitment to respect international laws on migration. “Fly Rider” also predicts that Macron will use the French army to impose a state of emergency, and call in the [non-existent] European army if French military refuse.
Like the May 1968 revolution, this rebellion is not without humour. “The people want Dior,” said graffiti on the boarded-up designer boutique on the avenue Montaigne. The black-painted “A” in “J’Adore Dior” was the circle A of anarchists. Over in the rue Cambon, “The scent of victory” was scrawled outside Chanel. “The planet is burning. The Élysée’s next” was another phrase.
Alternating tear gas and rain showers drove waves of yellow vests from the Champs-Élysées at sunset. I followed them to the left bank, where a fire burned on the quai d’Orsay. The glass bus shelter on the avenue de Latour Maubourg was shattered.
Back at the café Le Recrutement, the plate glass window had been smashed in. An 18-year-old youth, hit in the back by a police rubber bullet, was being loaded into an ambulance. Police frisked yellow vests lined up with their hands against a wall.
“We’re not terrorists,” two yellow vests pleaded, trying to talk their way into the vandalised cafe. “We’re evacuating everyone,” said the head waiter.
“A swarm of them came, from the suburbs, wearing ski masks,” the barman said. “They smashed the window with their fists. There’s blood on the glass.”
There were more shattered car and shop windows down the rue Saint Dominique. By miracle, I found an apricot tart in a 
. “Weren’t you afraid to stay open?” I asked the saleswoman. “We pulled down the blinds when they came by,” she said. “Look: my hands are still shaking.”
A friend arrived late for dinner. “It was chaos out there,” she said. “I passed two burning cars and a shoe shop being looted.”
Such is Paris life this holiday season.

 could have presented MPs on Thursday with a neutral motion that simply took note of her statement on the 
 negotiations earlier this week. Instead the UK prime minister asked them to reiterate their support for “the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this House on January 29th”.
It must have seemed like a clever idea at the time, but if there is one thing the conspiracy theorists in the 
 Group (ERG) are good at, it’s spotting conspiracies. They understood that the motion could be interpreted not only as a reaffirmation of their demand for changes to the Northern Ireland backstop but also as a rejection of a no-deal Brexit in line with another amendment passed on January 29th.
The DUP voted with the government, a smart move that tells the government that its 10 votes are available for a Brexit deal as long as the prime minister keeps her promise to secure changes to the backstop. It has the additional merit of warning the government that if the DUP is not satisfied with a renegotiated deal, it will vote against it rather than abstaining.
Some leading figures in the ERG were reluctant to be seen to be responsible for the government’s defeat but their decision to abstain rather than vote against the motion did nothing to blunt their action. The Brexiteers have weakened May’s negotiating hand in 
 and diminished her chances of winning the concessions on the backstop that they are demanding.
For the EU, Thursday’s vote is confirmation that last month’s majority for the Brady amendment was a freak phenomenon and that the will of the House of Commons remains unsettled. EU negotiators have no incentive to offer any concessions to the UK ahead of a vote on February 27th, when MPs will be able to back an amendment that would force the government to seek an extension to the article 50 negotiating period.
As Conservative former minister 
 told the House on Thursday, such an extension would offer MPs an opportunity to seek a consensus approach to Brexit. Such a consensus would almost certainly embrace a permanent customs union and possibly single-market membership.
Such a deal would be in the EU’s economic interest and would ease the difficulties Brexit creates for the Border, and Thursday’s vote will persuade EU leaders that it remains a possibility. While such hope is alive, why pass any concession on the backstop across the table to May, knowing that she will toss it into the furnace of the Conservative backbenches?
Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Driving around the UK this week is a strange experience. As the radio shouts about cliff edges and late-night press conferences and troops being put on standby, people drive to work and school, buses follow their time tables, and life goes on.
The last time I went to 
 in the west midlands and Reading in the southeast was in 2016, the week before the UK referendum on EU membership, and while some people had strong views then, many seemed strangely disengaged or even apathetic. Now, in contrast, everyone I speak to seems worn out and, in many cases, angry.
Some leave voters are still gleefully insistent that the 
 utopia is around the corner. Most are frustrated that the process isn’t easier, a few going so far as to say they would vote differently now. Others say that, although everything is terrible, “democracy” must out.
Remain voters, in contrast, seem saddened, scared and desperate for reprieve. Both leavers and remainers are united in a belief that their politicians are a disgrace and that everything is awful. They all emit an almost identical world-weary groan when asked about Brexit. You should imagine this groan before each of the conversations recounted below.
Danish Sophie Clausen and Italian Manuela Perteghella were so dejected in the aftermath of the referendum that they set up Stratford-upon-Avon’s “Brexit Café”. This is a semi-regular event that allows people from both sides to respectfully talk about their views as they eat biscuits and drink coffee.
For their first gathering they invited the Brexit-inclined Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi. Another event was invigorated by a London-based group of leave voters eager to set up a similar group back home. “I think they felt isolated in London,” says Perteghella.
“There were so many social media attacks and newspaper headlines [but] I don’t think people ever met face-to-face to discuss it,” says Clausen, who has lived in the UK since the 1990s. “It was about actually trying to understand each other’s points of view.”
Perteghella and Clausen are not nonpartisan. They are members of Stratford for 
 (the group’s logo is a picture of Shakespeare inside the 12 gold stars of the EU flag) and they want people to know how much this referendum, in which they couldn’t vote, hurt them.
Perteghella, who is also the local co-ordinator for the 3 Million, an advocacy group for EU citizens living in the UK, notes the red tape EU citizens face in order to remain in the country or change jobs.
“We’ve lived in fear and anxiety for the last three years,” says Clausen. “We have no idea what our status will be. Will we be degraded to second-class citizens? . . . I feel the country I came to has completely changed. I always loved this country and I was grateful, but I no longer feel welcome.”
Nearby, Rachel Dealtry, the remain-supporting day manager in a café called El Greco’s, tells me that Brexit makes her feel bad for her colleagues and she feels more European than British. There are three Britons among the 15 employees of El Greco’s.
Everyone there is fed up with Brexit but they make jokes about it, says Dealtry. When people leave work for the day, they say “I’m doing a Brexit”.
Stratford for Remain campaigner Mark Cunliffe tells me that the local service industry is heavily staffed by mainland Europeans and that restaurants are already finding it harder to get staff. He says that big employers such as Jaguar Land Rover are planning a long shut down in production at the start of April. He says he lost £50,000 (€58,140) due to currency fluctuations hitting his renewable energy-related business. He laughs. “I was on local TV recently and they asked me to stop looking down the camera so angrily.”
Jean Haslam in the Deli Café, which she owns and where I met her three years ago, is still an enthusiastic leave voter. Why? “We’re saturated. Polish, Romanians, all drawing on resources.”
What about the majority of Europeans who’ve been here for years, adding to the British economy? “I don’t think anything is going to happen to them,” she says, confidently.
Her sister, Violet Jordan, voted leave too but now thinks it was a mistake. “How could we win against all these countries?” she says.
Haslam thinks everything will be fine, that post-Brexit there’ll be more money for the National Health Service and that talk about food shortages or factory closures is “scaremongering”. So why hasn’t it gone smoothly? “Parliament are a disgrace.”
She introduces me to four older women who meet in her café every month.
“I voted leave but now I’ve switched to remain,” says Jackie Bell.
“I voted remain and now I’d vote leave,” says Jennifer Taylor.
Maddie Putt and Wendy Bailey, in contrast, high five each other over their unwavering support for leave.
Taylor initially voted to remain because she believed in the post-war union of nations. But the European Parliament’s behaviour since the referendum has turned her off. She calls them “tossers”.
Why did Bell change to a remain position? “Because of all the bother. . . I’m bored with it. I don’t understand it all.”
They admit that none of them realised it would all get so complicated. “We just thought it was going to be a simple thing,” says Putt. “I mean if you want to change your job you just put your notice in.”
At a neighbouring table I meet Ricky Roebuck. He’s a carer for his disabled 10-year-old daughter but back when he was looking for work, he says, he was competing with Polish people happy to take minimum wage in order to save money for houses back home. So, he voted leave.
He doesn’t have any problem, he adds, with people like his business-owning Albanian next-door neighbour who came to stay and “makes a massive contribution”.
But what if Brexit makes it difficult for people like him? He sighs. “Okay, it might be horrible to say it, but at the end of the day we’re British and have to look after ourselves.”
Now, he fears that Brexit will be indefinitely delayed. He doesn’t believe a no-deal Brexit would be as bad as some people say but he doesn’t trust the politicians to carry it out. I ask if it’s possible the leave campaign made it look too simple? “The remain campaign should have put their case across better. That’s their problem. That’s their own fault.”
Next door to Shakespeare’s childhood home, Sir Stanley Wells, the Shakespearean scholar and honorary president of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, tells me that he’s “vigorously opposed to Brexit . . . I feel our cultural intellectual ties with Europe are so important and I deplore anything that might break them down”.
It’s also probably not something that Shakespeare would have wanted. Wells once wrote a paper called “Shakespeare, Man of the European Renaissance”, and he points out several places where Shakespeare’s plays reference Ovid, Petrarch and Montaigne. “Shakespeare was soaked in European culture,” he says.
So why does he think people voted to leave? He talks about Britain’s insular streak and distrust of foreigners, but first he just laughs and says, “because they’re ignorant buggers”.
Across the road in the year-round Christmas-themed Nutcracker shop, I meet Steve Bartlett. Nearly three years ago, listening to the same Christmassy mix tape, Bartlett told me he was looking forward to leaving the EU. Now he sounds despairing. “I can’t believe what a fiasco it is. If I could find somewhere to run away and hide, I would.”
What did he think was going to happen? “I thought it would be more organised. I thought it could be a new start where we could stand up on our own.”
What way did his friends and family vote? “Fifty-fifty,” he says. “It was a class argument as much as anything else. The ones . . . who were struggling, wanted to leave. The ones who were doing all right, the middle class and richer, they wanted to remain.”
Would he vote differently if there was a second referendum? “I don’t think I’d even vote. That’s how downhearted I am. I don’t think I’ll ever vote for anything again.”
In a Caffe Nero, Anthony Rixon is talking to a tattooed Franciscan brother, Adam Lee, about potentially joining his order, when I come over and ask them about Brexit.
“I’ll take my hand off the Bible for a moment to say, ‘it’s bollocks’,” says Br Adam, who really does take his hands of his Bible to say this.
He voted to remain. Rixon voted to leave. Reading, in which 58 per cent of voters chose remain, is the first city in which I keep bumping into leave and remain voters hanging out together.
“I wanted us to govern our own country,” says Rixon. “But now I’d vote to stay just to get it over with.”
Br Adam voted remain because he didn’t think there was enough information. “I thought it was unrealistic. Lies like the £350 million for the NHS overshadowed everything for me [a leave slogan read “We send the EU £350 million a week. Let’s fund our NHS instead”]; and the border with Ireland wasn’t even mentioned before the vote.” (We mentioned it in Ireland, I point out).
“I just didn’t want to be ruled by Germany,” says Rixon. “Immigration was a bit of an issue for me, but I don’t mind people coming from Syria whose lives have been ripped apart or other people who come for good reasons.”
They both agree that it’s a mess now. “I’m just hoping they get it over with,” says Br Adam. “Rip the plaster off and get it done.”
“I hope there’s not another referendum because I think it would damage the country,” says Rixon. “But if there is, I’ll vote to stay. I’ll start speaking German. I don’t care any more.”
Bill Millis, a staunch leaver, is sitting near a statue of Queen Victoria with a younger remain-voting relative, James Jeffords. “We should come out on March 29th deal or no deal,” he says. “Europe has too much control over our country. They make our laws.”
A tiny percentage of the laws come from Europe, I point out. “But they still make them,” he says.
“We get a lot of economic benefits from Europe though,” says Jeffords, who works for the NHS. “It creates jobs. And we recruit people from abroad to do jobs that British people won’t do. And the hard border goes against the Good Friday Agreement. I’m an ex-soldier myself and I was over in Northern Ireland.”
They usually never talk about Brexit, and I’m worried for a moment that I’m causing an argument, but they quickly agree on several things – that the current fiasco would never have happened under Maggie Thatcher, that Tories are greedy, that a second referendum would be an affront to democracy and that it’s all a big mess.
“Nobody knew what they were voting for,” says Jeffords. “Nobody knew what the positives were and what the negatives were.”
“They still don’t know,” says Millis.
Outside the old Town Hall, Andrea Rixon, the inventor of the Omy (“a hands-free intimate stimulator for women”), tells me she wants to leave because “we’ve been dictated to so much by Europe”.
In what way? “Nothing I can think of on the spot but it’s just about taking back control.”
She thinks the EU has been making the Brexit process so onerous because Britain leaving might spark the end of the union as a whole. She insists that the business dangers are overblown and she isn’t worried about a no-deal Brexit. “It’s like a divorce. In a divorce you wouldn’t be beholden to an ex-partner.”
Remain supporter Pietro Riccio also uses a divorce metaphor, but he uses it to make a point about compromise. “In a divorce one person doesn’t get everything. There has to be a negotiation.”
He first arrived from Italy in 1974 just as the UK was entering the common market. He’s been “killing” his leaver friends Tony and Sapia Wyatt with Brexit conversation for an hour. He feels people were lied to and that Brexit is disastrous. The Wyatts disagree. “I wanted to leave the day after the vote,” says Tony. “I wanted the trade to be better for this country, without all the red tape you have in the EU.”
Are these debates a strain on their friendship? Riccio laughs. “No,” he says. “At the end of the day who’s going to suffer? People like us, the middle class.”
Retirees Maureen and 
 just laugh when I mention “the B word”. “We were all for it on the terms that were told to us, but the goalposts have moved,” says Brian.
“I don’t think we were told enough really,” says Maureen.
Would they vote the same way again? “Probably, on condition that we were put in the picture of what we were going to do and what we were not going to do,” says Brian.
Why did they vote to leave? Immigration was part of it, says Maureen. “I have no issues if they come in and work and support themselves . . .We can only support so many people.”
But don’t European citizens bring in more money than they take out? “It depends where you are,” says Maureen.
Nearby, florist Nicole Elizabeth is chatting to her friend, Smiths-playing busker Dan Curtis. She has British parents but was born and raised in Spain. She wants to stay in the EU.
That said, neither of them voted. “I didn’t understand it well enough to vote,” she says. “I don’t think people should vote on things they know nothing about. I think that was the problem.”
She rattles off the talking points of both sides. She knows the arguments better than a lot of people I’ve met who actually did vote. “I think people just voted for a drastic change,” she says. “None of the promises politicians made for years have come true. The people got sick of it so the one time they were asked to make a big decision they decided to vote for the unknown.”
Her mother, Wendy Lumley, who is visiting from Spain, believes Britain should leave the EU. She has no problem with immigration, she says, because, well, she’s an immigrant herself, but she does believe that Britain “should take control back from Brussels and stop giving them so much money”.
She adds that Brexit might yet affect her residency rights and ability to receive healthcare in Spain. “But I’m taking the high ground.”
Kieran Genius (“A hard name to live up to”) is a 24-year-old charity worker and aspiring journalist who voted remain and spent a lot of time trying to change the mind of his half-Jamaican mother who was voting leave. She has an issue with eastern European immigration, he says.
His friends, on the other hand, are largely remainers, but a lot of them didn’t vote. “They regret it now.”
He believes Brexit has unleashed some formerly-repressed racism. He spent time going door-to-door for a charity in London and, after the referendum, there was a big increase in people saying, “We don’t want to give any money to Africa, we want to keep it for Britain . . . People’s racism has been endorsed by Brexit.”
Dragos Gostian is a bit worried about his own future in the country. “There’s talk of people who earn less than £35,000 (€40,730) not being allowed to stay here. But an economy needs all kinds of jobs.”
Britain, he says, has been good to him until now. At home in Bucharest he couldn’t afford to live on his high-school teacher’s salary but here he can pay rent, eat and send money home on his earnings as a Deliveroo cyclist.
Beyond his own interests, he thinks Brexit is a big mistake for the UK. “I think to balance the US and China we need a big market in Europe. It’s not the time for the UK to leave that.”
Later that evening my car’s front-left tyre bursts on a slip-road on to the M4 and I am relieved to be bailed out by a kind and friendly Brexit-voting man from a free, car rescue service.
As we drive, he laments the European Commission’s “dirty tricks”, Europe’s ingratitude to Britain for saving them during the war and says that Britain wants to protect Ireland from the intransigent EU’s hard border.
I am so grateful to be rescued, I don’t contradict him once.

 Theresa May has offered Conservative MPs a free vote on Wednesday on a motion ruling out leaving the EU without a deal on March 29th after the House of Commons decisively rejected her 
 deal for a second time. If MPs rule out leaving without a deal, they will vote on Thursday on whether to postpone Brexit by extending the article 50 negotiating deadline.
MPs rejected the deal by 391 votes to 242, a majority of 149, after attorney general Geoffrey Cox said legally binding changes Mrs May secured in Strasbourg on Monday had not eliminated the risk that Britain could be trapped indefinitely in the Northern Ireland backstop. The DUP and most Conservative Brexiteers in the European Research Group (ERG) joined opposition parties to vote against the deal, although the margin was smaller than the 230 votes by which it was defeated in January.
The British government will publish on Wednesday morning information on tariffs and its approach to the Border in the event of a no-deal Brexit. More than half of Irish beef exports go to the UK and the Irish food industry fears that Britain will allow a quantity of certain food products to be imported tariff-free from countries such as Brazil, New Zealand and Australia.
EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier expressed regret at the Westminster vote on Tuesday night, adding that the impasse could only be resolved in Britain. “The EU has done everything it can to help get the withdrawal agreement over the line,” he said.
A spokesman for European Council president Donald Tusk echoed those sentiments and reminded Britain that any extension of the article 50 deadline would have to be approved by all 27 EU leaders.
“The EU for its part continues to stand by the withdrawal agreement including the backstop, which serves to prevent a hard border in Ireland and preserve the integrity of the single market unless and until alternative arrangements can be found,” the spokesman said.
“With only 17 days left to 29th March, today’s vote has significantly increased the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. We will continue our no-deal preparations and ensure that we will be ready if such a scenario arises. Should there be a UK reasoned request for an extension, the EU27 will consider it and decide by unanimity. The EU27 will expect a credible justification for a possible extension and its duration. The smooth functioning of the EU institutions will need to be ensured.”
Government sources in Dublin said the outcome of the vote was “regrettable” and added that “we’re now further intensifying our preparations for a no-deal Brexit”. 
Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said the onus was now on Britain to come up with solutions. He said a no-deal Brexit was “a lose-lose-lose for everybody” but avoiding such an outcome needed the Westminster parliament to “buy into the process and agree something which this evening they couldn’t do”.
Government spokesmen declined to be drawn on British tariffs on EU goods and arrangements on the Border in the event of a no-deal outcome. With no-deal fears growing, the proposals will be closely watched in Dublin and the North.
British business groups reacted angrily to last night’s vote, with Caroline Fairbairn, director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), calling for the main parties to work together to find a deal.
“Conservatives must consign red lines to history, Labour must come to the table with genuine commitment to solutions. It’s time to stop this circus,” she said.

The UK’s negotiating position was already weak when Theresa May walked into the council chamber at the Europa building in Brussels on Thursday. But she had one card left to play: the threat of a no-deal 
 next Friday, with all the disruption that would cause to the UK’s neighbours as well as itself. By the end of the night, that was gone too.
“All they had left was the date. Now we’ve taken that away from them,” a senior EU source said.
May’s presentation to the EU leaders and the question-and-answer session that followed persuaded them she had no chance of winning a majority for her deal at Westminster next week. So instead of coming back to Brussels next Thursday to decide whether to push the UK out of the EU 24 hours later, they drew up their own timetable for Brexit.
If May’s deal fails next week, the UK will leave the EU on April 12th unless it agrees to hold 
 elections and seeks a longer extension to hold a general election or a second referendum. The extra two weeks are designed to give MPs time to come up with an alternative to May’s deal that will command a majority, probably by changing or removing her negotiating red lines.
Already, 
 has tabled an amendment for Monday to set aside parliamentary time next week for MPs to debate alternatives to the prime minister’s deal. A cross-party group of MPs including Conservative 
 and Labour’s 
 wants indicative votes on competing options. And business secretary 
 suggested on Friday that the government would offer a free vote on indicative votes if the prime minister’s deal is rejected a third time next week.
The picture was further muddied on Friday night when it emerged that May had written to MPs suggesting she might not bring her withdrawal deal back to parliament for a third time if there is not enough support for it to be passed.
If Westminster must pursue new ideas for Brexit, May is singularly unsuitable to lead MPs in a new direction and her future as prime minister is in doubt this weekend. Her disastrous televised statement on Wednesday, when she blamed MPs for having to postpone Brexit, was the last straw for many ministers and backbenchers alike.
She had already alienated chief whip 
 by giving the nod to cabinet ministers that they could break a three-line whip by abstaining on a government motion. She cannot face another confidence vote in her leadership until next December, but there is a growing view at Westminster that if her Brexit deal is rejected next week, she will have to go.
The EU’s timetable does not allow enough time for a Conservative leadership contest, so May would have to hand over to a caretaker leader, preferably someone without leadership ambitions such as her de-facto deputy 
. But the factionalism within the party may be too poisonous for any caretaker leader to gain the confidence of Conservative MPs.
One of the reasons behind the continuing deadlock surrounding Brexit at Westminster is that the competing factions each believes that their preferred outcome can still prevail, making them unwilling to compromise by backing the next least bad option. Hard-line Brexiteers are confident the UK can leave the EU without a deal and the EU’s new deadline of April 12th will encourage them.
Corbyn thinks his proposal for a customs union and close alignment with the single market could form the basis for a deal that could win a majority. And those who favour Common Market 2.0, remaining in both the customs union and the single market, believe their plan can secure cross-party majority support.
But advocates for a second referendum, including the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, the Independent Group, many 
 MPs and a few Conservatives, still believe they can reverse Brexit. They will be emboldened by what is expected to be a huge demonstration in London on Saturday calling for a second vote and by the three million people who have signed a petition demanding that Brexit should be cancelled by revoking article 50.
The EU leaders have said that, if by April 12th the UK has not agreed to hold European Parliament elections, it must leave the EU that day. But if there appeared to be some progress at Westminster towards finding an alternative to May’s deal, would the EU really bundle Britain out the door right away?
Senior EU officials say there would be no question of offering a further extension to May 22nd, just before the European elections. But a short extension of two or three weeks would mean that, with Mrs May’s deal dead and no prospect of remaining in the EU for long enough to hold a second referendum, MPs would face a straight choice between a soft Brexit and no deal.

An Israeli court has ruled that a right-wing settler organisation can continue legal proceedings to evict 700 Palestinians from east Jerusalem’s 
 neighbourhood, even though the process by which it received rights to the land was flawed.
The high court rejected an appeal filed by 104 residents of Silwan, situated in a valley beneath Jerusalem’s old city, to overturn a September 2002 decision by the Custodian of Absentee Property to “free” the land on which they have lived for decades. The land was “freed” by people with links to 
, a right-wing Jewish association that encourages Jews to move into Arab east 
. 
The court sent the residents back to fight the civil proceedings that Ateret Cohanim has undertaken in order to evict them from their homes. 
Even though the court ruled in favour of Ateret Cohanim, it criticised the Israeli authorities for transferring the land to the settlers without notifying the Palestinian residents or even bothering to find out who lived there. The court also urged the state to compensate any Palestinians who may be evicted.
Up to 50,000 Palestinians live in Silwan alongside almost 3,000 Jewish religious settlers, but in recent years the Israeli government and the Jerusalem municipality have worked closely with Ateret Cohanim to evict Palestinians. 
The Palestinian petitioners live in a part of Silwan that was populated by Jews who came from 
 before the establishment of the state of 
 in 1948. During the Ottoman Empire, the neighbourhood in question was registered as belonging to a Jewish trust.
In 2001, the Jerusalem district court approved a government decision to appoint three members of Ateret Cohanim to run the trust – effectively giving the settler organisation control over the homes of 70 Palestinian families, comprising about 700 people.
Ateret Cohanim has already purchased a number of buildings in the neighbourhood and the first Jewish families have moved in. But the organisation claims it is not seeking confrontation. 
“Ateret Cohanim is hoping that the current residents will understand the return to the Yemenite village and will welcome their Jewish neighbours. It is hoped that all will be able to live in coexistence in the area, as was the case prior to the Arab rioting of the previous century. As opposed to walls being built around Jerusalem, Ateret Cohanim believes in coexistence between peoples,” a statement by the group said.
The Israeli human rights group 
 criticised the court ruling for failing to address the context.
“As though the land were not ‘freed’ by an association whose goal is to drive Palestinians out of their homes; as though the body of law does not allow Jews alone to file ownership for land abandoned in 1948; as though the court were not sanctioning the broadest move to dispossess Palestinians since 1967,” Btselem said in a statement. 
“The judgment proves, yet again, that the Israeli high court gives its seal of approval to almost any infringement of Palestinians’ rights by the Israeli authorities.”

It was not just the inherent drama of the occasion that made Michael Cohen’s testimony to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Wednesday so extraordinary. It was that everyone knew what kind of drama it was.
We had all seen the movie before. And it is a gangster movie. It is the scene near the end where we see the once trusted consigliere in court giving evidence against the mafia boss he had loved and served.

Clemency for a British academic jailed for life in the 
 on a spying charge is being considered by the Gulf state’s leaders, an official announced as he defended the nation’s judicial system.
Diplomatic efforts to free PhD student 
 are being led by foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt amid an outcry after the 31-year-old was handed the sentence earlier this week.
The 
 researcher’s wife, Daniela Tejada, has lobbied for his release and won assurances from Mr Hunt that the government is “now standing up for” her husband, after she claimed it had initially put foreign relations above his liberty.
In a statement at the UAE embassy in London on Friday, ambassador Sulaiman Almazroui praised the closeness between the two nations as he said clemency is being considered for the “extremely serious case”.
“Mr Hedges’s family have made a request for clemency and the government is studying that request,” he said.
“Because of the strength of that relationship we are hopeful that an amicable solution can be reached.”
He also made efforts to defend the judicial process, denying it was a “five-minute show trial” and claiming three judges evaluated “compelling evidence” over three hearings to make their ruling.
He did not address whether the academic was given adequate legal representation throughout the process, which Ms Tejada has said he lacked.
She swiftly rebuked the ambassador’s defence, saying her husband had been held in solitary confinement for more than five months without charge or lawyer, and when he did receive consular access he was not able to “talk openly”.
“The judicial system in the UAE and the UK cannot be compared,” she said in a statement.
“We have asked for clemency, we will wait to see what happens.”
The UAE has a history of issuing a wave of pardons in anticipation of its national day, which falls on December 2nd.
Despite the diplomatic efforts being made, Ms Tejada said her husband remains in fear that he will have to serve the entirety of his sentence, after speaking to him in a brief phone call on Thursday night.
“He is not well. He mentioned that his panic attacks have become worse than they were before. However, he did say that he has access to a doctor,” she told the BBC.
“I wasn’t allowed to know where he is, so still don’t know anything about his whereabouts, and I think he’s just absolutely terrified at the idea of having to spend the rest of his life behind bars for an offence he hasn’t committed.”
There are hopes that the UAE will show some leniency, with the head of its foreign ministry’s legal department, Abdulla al-Naqbi, also saying the nation wants to find an “amicable solution”.
However, he added that “compelling and powerful evidence” had proved espionage, including computer analysis and an alleged confession.
Ms Tejada has stressed her husband’s innocence and said the Middle East expert, who was finishing his thesis, was the victim of a “misunderstanding” while carrying out research.
Mr Hunt said he had seen “absolutely no evidence” to support claims that Mr Hedges was spying when he visited 
 earlier this year, and he threatened “serious diplomatic consequences” if he was not freed.
The cabinet minister said on Thursday night that he had had a “constructive conversation” with his UAE counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed.
But this came after he had previously voiced surprise at the life sentence handed to Mr Hedges on Wednesday, which came despite his discussions with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed a little over a week earlier.
Mr Hedges, originally from 
, was arrested at Dubai airport as he tried to leave the country on May 5th.
Prof Stuart Corbridge, vice-chancellor of Durham University, said there was “no reason to believe that Matt was conducting anything other than legitimate academic research”.
Mr Hedges was given 30 days to challenge the court ruling, and Ms Tejada has launched a petition on Change.org which has gathered more than 160,000 signatures. – PA

 has refused to rule out resigning as prime minister if MPs reject her 
 deal, raising the stakes ahead of a summit in Brussels on Sunday where European Union leaders are expected to approve it. Asked three times during a BBC phone-in on Friday, the prime minister repeatedly declined to say she would carry on in Number 10 if the deal is voted down in parliament.
“I am focused on ensuring we get this deal. I believe it’s the right deal for the UK. As I’m sitting here I am not thinking about me but getting a deal for this country. That’s what drives me,” she said.
“I am going to be around the country, explaining the deal up and down the country. I think this is important. It’s not just about MPs it’s about people understanding what the country is about.” 
More than 80 Conservative backbenchers have indicated that they could vote against the deal, as have the DUP’s 10 MPs who want the prime minister to scrap the Northern Ireland backstop. 
, who resigned as Brexit secretary last week, said Mrs May’s proposals were worse than remaining in the EU.
“I’m not going to advocate staying in the EU. But, if you just presented me terms, this deal or EU membership, because we would effectively be bound by the same rules but without the control or voice over them, yes, I think this would be even worse than that,” he told the BBC.
The prime minister said he believed her deal was a good one for Britain and that it ensured that the country’s future would be in its own hands. She said that if MPs rejected the deal in a “meaningful vote” next month, there would be little point in returning to Brussels seeking to renegotiate it. 
“I don’t think they will come to us and say we’ll get a better deal. I’m making sure we get this through parliament. If we don’t, what we will see is more division and uncertainty. My focus, all my focus, is getting . . . we’ve got to finalise the deal on Sunday but beyond that it’s getting the vote through,” she said.
Mrs May said she would travel around Britain in the coming weeks to take her case for the Brexit deal directly to the people beyond Westminster. Downing Street is working to persuade MPs at Westminster too and some reacted cynically to the news that 
, a Brexiteer who is backing the deal, is to be knighted.
Downing Street dismissed speculation that, if the deal is voted down next month, MPs could be asked to vote again as the 
 Congress did 10 years ago on the Tarp bank rescue deal, which passed on the second vote. Mrs May declined to say what her Plan B is if the deal is rejected, describing her job as persuading people it is a good deal. 
“The job of an MP is to say to themselves: ‘Does this deliver on what people voted for?’ And I believe it does deliver . . . this should be at the forefront of people’s minds,” she said.

, the Italian deputy prime minister and leader of the anti-establishment 
 (M5S), has met a senior figure from the 
 (yellow vests) movement – a meeting likely to increase tensions between 
 and 
. 
Mr Di Maio and 
, a prominent 
 member, met Christophe Chalençon, as well as candidates that the protest movement has put forward for the European elections in May, on the outskirts of Paris on Tuesday. Posting a photograph of the group on 
, Mr Di Maio described it as a “beautiful” meeting.
“The wind of change has crossed the Alps. I repeat. The wind of change has crossed the Alps,” he wrote.
Mr Di Maio had previously expressed his admiration for the gilets jaunes, who have been holding at-times violent anti-government protests each week across France for the past few months. He urged the movement not to “give up” and said the demonstrations reminded him of the spirit that gave birth to the Five Star Movement in 2009.
On Tuesday he said the two groups shared “many common positions and values that focus on the battles for citizens, social rights, direct democracy and the environment”.
Mr Chalençon said that while the two sides “practically agree on everything”, there was no talk yet about whether they would form an alliance for the elections to the 
. Italian media reported that 
, who heads the gilets jaunes’ list of 10 candidates for the elections, will meet M5S officials again in Rome next week.
The meeting follows a series of verbal attacks from Mr Di Maio and his co-deputy prime minister, 
, on the French president, 
, in recent weeks and is also seen as an additional tactic by M5S to regain some of the popularity lost to Mr Salvini’s far-right League since the coalition government came to power last June.
“M5S is weak right now,” said 
, a politics professor at Luiss University in Rome. “They are losing traction in their traditionally antagonistic contingencies and they need to find every antagonistic issue to demonstrate that they are strong. Macron is also the perfect target for populist movements.”
Mr Panarari added that the meeting with the gilets jaunes was also a way to tell Italian voters that the Five Star Movement still has its “anti-establishment soul” as well as to attract similar groups with whom they might be able to build a coalition after the EU elections.
M5S launched its European election campaign in January, with Mr Di Maio and Mr Di Battista travelling to the European Parliament in 
 and denouncing the institution as a “waste of money”. At the time, Mr Di Maio said he was preparing an election manifesto with other European populist groups.
Opinion polls in France have suggested that the main impact of one or more gilets jaunes candidates standing in the European elections would be to reduce support for the far-right of 
 and the far left, led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon.
A survey last month by Elabé showed 13 per cent of voters could vote for a gilets jaunes party, knocking three points off the score of Ms Le Pen’s National Rally and 1.5 points off that of Mr Mélenchon’s France Unbowed, and extending the lead of Mr Macron’s 
. 
“A gilets jaunes party would likely mobilise people who do not usually vote, but also take votes from the National Rally and France Unbowed,” Emmanuel Rivière of pollsters Kantar Public France told 
. “Paradoxically, the principal beneficiary would be the party of the president.”
An Ifop opinion poll published on Wednesday showed Macron’s approval rating surging from 23 per cent in December to 34 per cent in February. – Guardian

Numerous violent incidents broke out in Paris on Saturday during the fourth weekly demonstration by 
 protesters wearing yellow high visibility security vests.
The government deployed a record 89,000 security forces, including police and para-military 
 in armoured vehicles. The interior ministry said 125,000 people demonstrated across 
, including 8,000 in Paris. The protesters accused “corrupt media” of underestimating their numbers.
By 5.30pm, 1,385 people had been arrested in the Paris region, of whom 920 were charged, mostly for “participation in a group which is preparing violence against persons or property.” The injured came to 171, including three police and 
. The ministry of justice estimated the numbers demonstrating nationwide at 125,000.
The violent 
 or vandals who have infiltrated the movement burned tyres, cars and vegetation in the streets and smashed windows. Some looting was reported near the Gare Montparnasse. The Place de l’Étoile, where the Arc de Triomphe was covered with graffiti one week earlier, was the epicentre of the violence.
While riot police held the area immediately around the triumphal arch, protesters seized plywood panels used to protect shopfronts and advanced behind them as shields. They attacked Le Drugstore at the top of the Champs-Élysées.
Rioters on the nearby Avenue de Friedland built a barricade of burning rubbish bins. Scuffles occurred near the Parc Monceau and the Gare St Lazare. Gendarmes were equipped with armoured personnel carriers for the purpose of breaking down barricades.
The big department stores on the boulevard Haussmann were closed, as were many cultural and tourist sites, including the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre, Orsay and Grand Palais museums. Forty-five metro and suburban RER train stations in central Paris were shut down.
Numerous football matches, Christmas markets and other events have been cancelled because of the riots.
Security forces formed an impenetrable barrier around the approaches to the Élysée Palace, at the bottom of the Champs Élysée. “Macron is in there,” said Benoit, a 31-year-old management consultant who had returned home from London to join the protests, gesturing beyond the phalanx of police towards the Élysée.
“He gets €20,000 a month and he doesn’t have any rent or bills to pay while people are croaking…It’s not right to have poverty in such a rich country.”
Police frisked pedestrians every few hundred metres, confiscating goggles and items that could be used as weapons. A ski pole lay on the ground in a street near the Eiffel Tower where the windows of cars, shops and restaurants had been smashed in.
Many of the yellow vests brandished French tricolours. The marches began on November 17th in protest at new carbon taxes on petrol and diesel, but quickly expanded to a broader expression of anger at sinking purchasing power and standards of living. Four people were killed in earlier demonstrations.
The interior minister 
 urged calm: “I ask the yellow vests who want to bring about a peaceful outcome not to support the violent people. We know the violent people are only strong because they hid themselves within the yellow vests, which hampers the security forces,” he said.
Other movements have latched on to the distress of the working poor to exploit them politically, including extreme left and extreme right-wing anti-EU factions.
President Emmanuel Macron agreed to cancel the fuel price hikes, but the protests continue and demonstrators yesterday spoke of renewed marches in coming weeks. Demonstrators demand the re-establishment of the wealth tax abandoned by Macron in 2017, early elections and even Macron’s resignation.
The president will speak at the beginning of next week, his close ally, Richard Ferrand, the speaker of the National Assembly said. Macron did not express himself before Saturday’s demonstrations so as not to “pour oil on the flames,” Mr Ferrand said.

Historically and culturally, 
 and 
 are extremely close. Trade between the two countries represents a whopping €200 million daily. Yet relations between them have deteriorated almost to breaking point.
The French foreign ministry summoned the Italian ambassador for a dressing down this week, after 
, the leader of Italy’s populist Five Star Movement (M5S), as well as a deputy prime minister and minister for economic development, labour and social policy, blamed France for the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean.
France’s ambassador to Rome was summoned in a similar fashion twice last year, when tempers frayed over a border incident and Italy’s refusal to allow the migrant ship Aquarius to dock.
After several boats carrying migrants sank in the Mediterranean recently, claiming at least 170 lives, Mr Di Maio denounced French “hypocrisy” and “crocodile tears”.
“If today people are leaving, it’s because certain European countries, chief among them France, never stopped colonising dozens of African countries,” Mr Di Maio said on January 20th, calling for EU sanctions against France. “France prints the currency, the colonial franc, in dozens of African countries, and with this currency they finance the French debt . . . If France didn’t have the African colonies, she would be the world’s 15th economic power, but she’s among the first because of what she’s doing in 
. ”
Mr Di Maio’s coalition partner 
, head of the far-right Lega, and who is also a deputy prime minister and the minister of the interior, added his own insults, calling on his 
 page for the French to “liberate themselves from a very bad president in the next European elections”. 
 “preaches about solidarity, but turns back thousands of migrants”, Mr Salvini said.
Mr Macron has portrayed European elections in May as a contest between his camp, which he defines as liberal, pro-European and progressive, and Mr Salvini’s, which he portrays as narrow-minded, nationalist and populist. Last summer, he referred to the M5S-Lega coalition as “leprosy”.
On January 7th, Mr Di Maio urged French 
 demonstrators to “hang in there”. He offered them logistical support to create a website comparable to the Rousseau platform used by M5S to come to power.
“The M5S platform advocates shutting down parliament and replacing it with direct democracy, because the politicians are stuffing their pockets. The 
have invented nothing new,” says 
, director of projects at the pro-EU think tank Volta Italia.
Salvini and Di Maio have different reasons for antagonising the French. “Salvini is allied with [French far-right leader] 
. He wants to lead the nationalists in 
, and he and Macron are sworn enemies,” says Ms Maurel.
“Di Maio is losing ground to Salvini, and he has understood that being anti-French pays politically, so he’s using outrageous statements as a publicity stunt,” Ms Maurel continues. “Confrontation is . . . their strategy for the European election campaign, so we’re likely to see more of this in coming weeks. They’ve found the perfect enemy.”
The tension between France and Italy started before Macron, Salvini and Di Maio came to power. Italy resented French intervention in Libya, a former Italian colony. Italian pride was also hurt when the French snapped up €52.3 billion worth of Italian companies in the decade between 2006 and 2016, particularly during the 2008 economic crisis. 
There has been further resentment over Mr Macron’s resistance to the sale of a French STX shipyard to the Italian company 
. 
In Moscow for the World Cup final last summer, Mr Salvini announced he was rooting for 
. The French team had so many Africans that it wasn’t really French, he explained. “I heard the same thing from ordinary Italians,” Ms Maurel recalls. “Salvini and Di Maio have touched a chord. One senses love, fascination, rivalry and perhaps some jealousy on the part of Italian people.”
Mr Macron and the previous Italian prime minister, 
, had envisioned a “Treaty of the Quirinale”, similar to 
 this week. The annual Franco-Italian summit did not take place last year, and the treaty is on hold. So is the plan for a high-speed train between 
 and Turin.
Italy also backtracked on an agreement to lend the Louvre paintings by Leonardo da Vinci for an exhibition marking the 500th anniversary of the death of the Renaissance genius. Leonardo spent the last four years of his life in France, under the protection of King François I. 
“Leonardo was Italian,” Italy’s culture minister, 
, a member of Mr Salvini’s party, insisted when she cancelled the loan. Sending the paintings to Paris would threaten Italy’s national interests, she said.

French police fired tear gas, stun grenades and water cannon in battles with "yellow vest" protesters trying to breach security cordons on the Champs Elysees in Paris on Saturday (December 1) ahead of a third rally against high living costs.

French president 
 was forced to make a humiliating and unprecedented climbdown on Tuesday in the face of continuing street protests. He left it to prime minister 
 to announce measures including a six-month suspension of price hikes on petrol and diesel.
But initial reaction from the gilets jaunes, or yellow vests, the movement behind anti-government protests across the country, indicated the policy reversal might be too little too late.
Philippe began by acknowledging the long-simmering anger of much of the French population. “One would have to be deaf and blind not to see it, not to hear it,” he said.
On December 1st, the third march in as many weeks descended into rioting that ravaged much of central Paris. Four people have died in the protests.
In line with traditional French indulgence towards political violence, Philippe said the anger was that of “hard-working 
, which has a hard time making ends meet, of French people who have their back against the wall, of mothers raising children alone. This anger has its source in a profound injustice. That of not being able to live decently from the fruit of one’s labour”.
The long-ignored yellow vests had suddenly become “French people who love their country”, who “want taxes to go down and work to pay”.
That was also the government’s goal, Philippe said. “If I did not succeed in expressing that, if the majority found it difficult to convince the French, we must change something.”
The government has enacted measures for the disadvantaged, including lowering the habitation tax and social charges, and a scheduled 3 per cent rise in the minimum wage, Philippe noted. But those measures have remained invisible and inaudible to a large segment of the population who view Macron as the “president of the rich”.
A year ago, Macron staged a “One Planet Summit” in Paris. In line with France’s commitment to reduce greenhouse emissions, he programmed a 2.9 cents per litre rise in the price of petrol, and a 6.5 cents per litre rise for diesel from January 1st.
Now, to the chagrin of environmentalists, the carbon tax will be “suspended” for six months. Philippe’s promise that the taxes “will not be applied before being debated by all parties involved” implied they may never happen.
The government also renounced aligning prices for petrol and diesel. For years, the buyers of diesel vehicles were given bonuses, in the mistaken belief that it was less polluting.
The government is suspending more thorough motor vehicle tests, another grievance of the yellow vests. A scheduled rise in home heating costs has also been suspended. Commuters will be given a “mobility bonus”. The government will invest more in housing, and “open a broad debate on taxes and public spending”.
Measures promised by Philippe will cost the state at least €2 billion.
But will it be enough? Yellow vest supporters said it might have been, earlier, but they were too angry to turn back now. Many demand restoration of the pre-Macron wealth tax.
“They’ve already tricked us by claiming to hear us, then ignoring us completely,” was a typical reaction on the France Info website.
“Suspending doesn’t mean cancelling,” wrote another. “The government must expect a hardening of the movement.”
Macron on Tuesday visited the prefecture that was burned by rioters at Puy-en-Velay, upper Loire, to express support for civil servants there. About 20 demonstrators gathered outside and jeered him with cries of “Macron resign” on his departure. Protesters pursued his motorcade until bodyguards got out to confront them.
Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the May ’68 revolutionary, former MEP and a friend of Macron, told France Inter radio that the president “must question himself. He has the ability and the agility to do so. He must fundamentally question his practice of power”.
The measures announced by Philippe would not be enough, Cohn-Bendit predicted. “Now the president has to say where he is going, where we must go. He has to put everything on the table” including partial abrogation of the wealth tax.
Macron is paying for his lack of political experience, Cohn-Bendit said. “You can’t always be first in the class. You have to say, ‘Maybe, even if I was right, if it doesn’t work you have to replace it.’ You have to find a solution to calm people in the face of inequality.”
France waits to see what will happen on Saturday, when the yellow vests have called for a fourth nationwide demonstration. Philippe said the marches “must be declared [in advance] and must take place peacefully”.
At the request of the Paris prefecture, a football match between Paris St Germain and Montpellier, a televised benefit for rare diseases and the annual “Animals’ Christmas,” all scheduled for Saturday, have been cancelled.
Speaking before the Senate later in the day, interior minister 
 appealed to “reasonable yellow vests not to gather in Paris on Saturday”.

A driver died in southern 
 on Friday when his car hit a truck at a roadblock erected by “yellow vest” protesters, raising the death toll linked to the anti-government demonstrations to 10, authorities said on Saturday.
Several “yellow vest” demonstrations were expected across France on Saturday, including a march in the formal royal city of 
, whose castle is a symbol of French state power and one of Europe’s top tourist attractions.
But very few people gathered in Versailles and there were far fewer demonstrators in the streets of Paris than in previous weeks, according to Reuters witnesses and news channels BFM and CNews.
Dozens marched through the streets of Montmartre near the Sacré-Coeur Basilica, another tourist landmark, shouting: “Parisians, join us!” Other protesters called for the resignation of president 
. 
About 800 people were demonstrating in Paris at about 11am GMT and there had been no incidents of violence or arrests, police said. This compares with about 4,000 demonstrators at the same time last Saturday.
Three weeks ago the protests in Paris turned into some of the worst unrest seen in the capital since 1968. Cars were set on fire, the windows of banks and insurance offices were smashed and street furniture was vandalised.
Of the 10 deaths linked to the protests, most have been the result of road accidents. 
The driver who died in the accident near 
 on Friday evening, which occurred at a roundabout blocked off by protesters, was a 36-year-old man, a police source told Reuters.
The “gilets jaunes” (yellow vest) protests – named after the high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their cars – began in mid-November to rally against fuel tax increases before growing into a wider movement against the liberal economic reform policy of Mr Macron, who made tax and salary concessions earlier this month to stem the demonstrations.
The movement has gradually lost steam in recent weeks, with just 66,000 people taking part in protests nationwide last Saturday compared with nearly 300,000 on November 17th. – Reuters

Thousands of protesters took to the streets of French cities on Saturday in the fifth weekend of demonstrations against Emmanuel Macron’s government, ignoring calls to hold off after a gun attack in 
 this week.
In Paris, police were out in force for the protest. But the demonstrations were noticeably smaller than in previous weeks, possibly in response to the Strasbourg attack or to the cold, rainy weather.
Police fired water cannons and teargas in the afternoon to disperse groups of protesters in sporadic, brief clashes on the Champs-Élysées and adjacent streets. Topless feminist activists braved the cold to face off with security forces, a few metres away from the Élysée Palace, the president’s residence. And French media showed footage of clashes between police and protesters in 
, western 
, and further south in 
 and 
.
The “yellow vest” protest movement started in mid-November with demonstrations at junctions and roundabouts against fuel tax increases, but quickly became a wider mobilisation against Mr Macron’s economic policies. Successive weekends of protests in Paris have led to vandalism and violent clashes with security forces. Despite the protests in the city, several major stores, such as the 
, opened to lure in Christmas shoppers.
 (44), marching on the Champs-Élysées in a yellow vest on Saturday, said the protests were more subdued, but the movement would go on until the demonstrators’ grievances were addressed. “Since the Strasbourg attack, it is calmer, but I think next Saturday and the following Saturdays . . . it will come back.”
Interior minister 
 said about 69,000 police were active on Saturday, with a reinforced presence in Toulouse, Bordeaux and 
. Official figures said 66,000 protesters had been counted in France by 5pm GMT, compared with 126,000 at the same time a week before.
In Paris, some 4,000 protesters marched in splintered groups in several neighbourhoods, and at least 168 were arrested, a police official said.
On Friday, 
 had called for a return to calm in France after nearly a month of the protests. The demonstrations have hit growth and caused widespread disruption. “France needs calm, order and a return to normal,” Mr Macron said, after a meeting of 
 leaders in 
.
In a televised address last Monday, Mr Macron announced wage rises for the poorest workers and tax cuts for pensioners in further concessions meant to end the movement, but many activists said they would maintain pressure.

 Like millions of Germans on Friday, 
 was glued to the suspense-filled handover of power in Hamburg. 
Gels is the CDU mayor of 
, a rural town in Lower Saxony where his party scored its strongest federal election result in the country: a whopping 53 per cent, exactly double the disastrous national figure.
But that result was down 10 points on 2013, and even Gels, professing his “huge respect” for 
, concedes that her time had passed.
Merkel’s political legacy remains, he says: unflappable in the euro crises, nonplussed by alpha-male populists and behind a “courageous decision in 2015 to let in people fleeing for their lives”.
Then comes the but.
“There has been too much pussyfooting around,” said Gels, “and that annoys and unsettles people.”
Ask him – or any other German mayor – where things are stuck, and you should brace yourself for a long list. 
Three years of emergency summit shadow-boxing over diesel and the future of mobility – and this in the country that invented the internal combustion engine.
Doubts over whether 
 can manage the so-called “energy transition” to renewables in 2022, when the last nuclear plant goes from the grid.
And, like Ireland, Germany is tied up in procedural knots over broadband rollout, with many fearing Europe’s leading industry nation will miss the digital revolution.
The 15-year Merkel era so far has been a time of prosperity and stability in Germany compared with elsewhere in Europe, with a postwar record jobless low and a series of balanced budgets. But critics suggest Merkel pushed no major social, economic or tax reforms of her own, and allowed a drastic slide in Germany’s climate change ambition.
Instead of deciding the big future projects, Gels – echoing many around Germany – suggests Merkel-era Germany embraced a sit-it-out approach on crucial decisions.
“If I make a decision I know at least one person will be against me,” he says, “but if I make no decision I have everyone against me, and then the populists move in and promise everything.”
Merkel critics are quick to blame their departed leader for a soporific mood both in the CDU and Berlin’s corridors of power.
But as party leader, Merkel was re-elected biannually with levels of support that never dipped below 88 per cent. In almost two decades, she transformed the CDU from an ageing party of the right beyond urban areas to a centrist party more palatable with younger city dwellers.
Her CDU modernised – slaughtering holy cows such as nuclear power, military service and euro bailouts – but always with a resounding party conference mandate.
Even her controversial August 2015 decision not to close German borders to asylum seekers, allowing the rise of the far-right AfD, was backed by CDU delegates four months later.
The euro crisis made her Europe’s indispensable leader, insisting that “if the euro fails, Europe fails”. But she earned the name “Madame Non” for being quick to dismiss – or water down beyond recognition – others’ ideas without any better proposals. This week’s compromise on French euro reform proposals was the latest example of that habit.
Leading CDU figures in Hamburg conceded Germany, under Merkel, has been sleepwalking into the post-Brexit EU and demanded a “new style” of leadership.
“I understand that this chancellorship was influenced by crises,” said 
, powerful CDU state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia. “But it would be nice if we entered a new era in which Germany sets its own impulses.”
Delegates in Hamburg from Vechta and environs agreed, saying German voters wanted a new start, clear decisions and long-term strategy.
As delegate 
 put it: “The arbitrariness in Germany politics has to end.”

Police used tear gas on the Champs-Élysées after a day of largely peaceful demonstrations in Paris on the fifth straight weekend of protests by France’s “yellow vest” movement.
The demonstrations against France’s high cost of living were significantly smaller on Saturday than at previous rallies, some of which scarred parts of Paris with vandalism and looting.
A few thousand people marched up and down the famed shopping street in Paris, a spirited yet peaceful gathering that sunk into violence as the afternoon wore on.
Riot police clashed with demonstrators as the occasional tourist darted from their hotel or a brave Christmas shopper took a peek at the neighbourhood’s mostly boarded-up storefronts.
By late afternoon, a water cannon in a line of police vans confronting protesters sprayed water to disperse them.
Firefighters put out a blaze on a side street leading to the Champs-Élysées and limited scuffles broke out between protesters and police.
By early evening, police had cleared the avenue and reopened it to traffic.
Protesters made it clear that they wanted to keep up the pressure, even if their numbers were far smaller than in previous weeks, which saw rioters smashing and looting stores and setting up burning barricades in the streets.
French law enforcement was out in force. About 8,000 police and 14 armoured vehicles were deployed in Paris for the demonstration, and streets of central Paris were honeycombed with checkpoints where officers in riot gear checked bags and coats for weapons.
Police said 115 people were taken into custody in Paris, most for banding together to commit acts of violence, and a small number were injured.
Police in riot gear tackled one protester and dragged him off the Champs-Élysées, while his friends said he was doing nothing but exercising right to protest.
The “yellow vest” movement, which takes its name from the fluorescent safety vests French motorists must have in their vehicles, started in mid-November with protests at junctions and roundabouts against fuel tax increases, but quickly became a wider mobilisation against Macron’s economic policies.
Without any clear leadership, it has attracted a wide range of disgruntled people across France’s political spectrum, including some violent militants.
Yellow vest protests were also being held in other parts of 
, blocking roads and highways.
Loic Bollay (44), marching on the Champs-Élysées, said the protests were more subdued but the movement would go on until the demonstrators’ grievances were addressed. “Since the 
 attack, it is calmer, but I think next Saturday and the following Saturdays . . . it will come back.”
On Friday, president Emmanuel Macron called for a return to calm in France while several unions and politicians had called on protesters to stay off the streets, after four people were killed in a gun attack at a Christmas market in Strasbourg on Tuesday.
The number of deaths linked to the protest rose to seven after Belgian police said a man accidentally crashed his car on Friday night into a truck that had stalled at a yellow vest roadblock on the French-Belgian border.– AP/Reuters

France’s “yellow vest” demonstrators kept numerous roads across the country blocked on Saturday as groups of protesters marched in city centres, but the anti-government backlash was more dispersed and muted than in previous weeks.
Driven by anger over a perceived squeeze on household income, the movement has shaken Emmanuel Macron’s presidency and hurt retailers and other businesses after the spontaneous protest against fuel taxes gave way to riots in early December.
Sporadic clashes with police broke out as protesters in several cities including 
 and 
 were pushed back by teargas and stun grenades, though the turnout across 
 dwindled on the seventh Saturday of demonstrations.
Official estimates were not yet available, though French TV channel LCI, citing unnamed sources, put the turnout at 12,000, well below the nearly 40,000 last week.
In Paris, where protests turned violent in early December, police said by early evening they had detained some 57 people after 800 demonstrators took to the streets, down from at least 109 arrests last week with a similar number of protesters.
People wearing high-visibility vests mingled among shoppers and tourists and chanted “Macron, resign!” on the Champs Elysees, home to boutiques that were smashed and bore the brunt of lootings at the height of the violence.
Major stores, including some that were boarded up on recent weekends, opened their doors.
Other demonstrators converged west of the capital near the headquarters of 24-hour news channel BFM TV, where scuffles ensued, and several cars were set on fire outside the offices of the Parisien newspaper in the evening, though it was initially unclear who had torched them and whether it was directly linked to the protests.
In 
, where crowds exceeded 2,000 people, protesters set bins on fire and some hurled yellow paint at police.
Several highway tolls and motorway slip-roads across France were blocked, operator 
 said, and traffic on some of the roads leading to 
 was severely backed up.
The protests – 18 months into Mr Macron’s tenure, and his bid to reshape the economy – are expected to rumble on into January despite his attempts to defuse them, including by backtracking on planned fuel tax hikes and signalling wage rises for the poorest workers.
“We will continue until we win, until Macron backs down and gives us what we deserve: more purchasing power, less taxes, a healthy life without having to tighten and tighten and tighten the belt at the end of every single month,” a protester in Nantes who only gave her name as Virginie told Reuters.
“My son asks me for something and [I say] no I can’t, but I work so it is not normal.”
Stemming in part from a feeling of disconnect between more provincial and rural areas and an urban elite Mr Macron has come to represent to his critics, the protest has spawned sit-ins at roundabouts and roadsides as people dig their heels in, demanding more measures to help household incomes.
The “yellow vest” protests – named after the garments that drivers have to carry in their cars in case of emergency – have been concentrated on Saturdays, after first erupting on November 17th following a campaign spread on social media.
But protesters were also being urged to turn out on December 31st, including for a show of force on the Champs Elysee, where revellers tend to gather for New Year’s celebrations and a firework display.
The city council has said festivities, usually boxed in by a heavy police presence, would go ahead as planned.

Romanian president 
 has called for a renewed fight against corruption, as his battle with the country’s scandal-plagued government clouds preparations for its first EU presidency.
Romania’s six-month tenure starting in January is expected to include oversight of Brexit, hard-fought elections to the 
 and talks on a new long-term budget for the bloc.
Although most of the rotating presidency’s tasks are organisational, top officials in Brussels are concerned that the bitter struggle between Mr Iohannis and Romania’s populist government could distract from EU matters at hand.
Mr Iohannis and many compatriots oppose the government’s overhaul of Romania’s criminal justice system, its decriminalisation of certain graft offences and its successful campaign to remove the country’s top anti-corruption prosecutor.
Critics say the reforms favour powerful members and backers of the ruling Social Democrats (PSD), and they have triggered the biggest street protests seen in 
 since its 1989 anti-communist revolution, including a rally in August during which about 450 people were hurt in a crackdown by riot police.
“Corruption is a disease that eats away at democracy and traps millions of people in poverty,” Mr Iohannis said on Sunday.
“Corruption means a lack of motorways, insanitary hospitals, underfunded schools, blocked administration ... Honesty and integrity must be reinstated at all levels of our society.”
The 
 and 
 have raised serious concerns over Romania’s recent reforms, and Brussels still conducts special monitoring of its judicial system and anti-corruption efforts, 11 years after it joined the bloc.
Critics say the reforms will favour PSD leader 
, who cannot serve as premier after being convicted of vote rigging and abuse of office, and so instead guides prime minister Viorica Dancila’s government from behind the scenes.
Ms Dancila notified Romania’s constitutional court last week about Mr Iohannis’s refusal to immediately approve new transport and development ministers, causing a delay that she said could hinder preparations for the EU presidency.
Mr Iohannis responded on Friday by saying that “de facto Romania does not have a prime minister” because the government was “run by the criminal Dragnea through intermediaries” and that the PSD sought to rule through decree rather than negotiation.
The fractious PSD has replaced three premiers in two years after they clashed with Mr Dragnea, and a cabinet reshuffle last month claimed six ministers following a fresh power struggle; opposition parties are discussing holding a vote of no confidence in the government this week.
In late October Ms Dancila said 
 president Jean-Claude Juncker had called for a “truce” between Romania’s government and opponents, to meet what she called the “need for consensus, for calm, for political disputes to take second place so we can focus on the national interest”.

The atmosphere in 
 remained anxious and tense on Monday, as militants from the “yellow vests” movement called for further demonstrations in Paris next Saturday.
An 80-year-old woman who was hit in the face by a projectile as she closed the shutters of her apartment in Marseille during rioting on Saturday became the fourth person to die in the violence.
The first 57 of 630 people detained by police on December 1st were brought before judges.  
President 
 remained silent, despite intense pressure from his own camp and the opposition to address the three-week-old social movement that has degenerated into street violence, vandalism and looting. If Macron cannot retake control the last 3½ years of his term are threatened.
Macron lunched with CRS riot police who had clashed with rioters in the capital, and left it to the prime minister, 
, to receive the leaders of political parties. The government has been criticised for deploying only 5,000 police in Paris on Saturday, the day of the worst violence, and for not calling in the army to maintain order.
The politicians asked Philippe for a moratorium on the carbon tax that sparked the demonstrations. Some demanded a rise in the minimum wage and pensions, the re-establishment of a tax on capital gains and more funding for public services.
“I told him that the strategy of confrontation chosen by Emmanuel Macron could have tragic consequences,” the far-right leader 
 told journalists as she left the prime minister’s office. If Macron did not change tack, she warned, “He could become the first president in half a century to fire on demonstrators.”
A 
 page titled “Paris Insurrection Act 4!” called on demonstrators to reconvene on the Champs-Élysée on December 8th. At least 13 different calls for an “Act 4” have been published on social media, and thousands of people have said they will participate.
Several French prefects, responsible for security at the department level, spoke of “an explosive, semi- insurrectional, pre-revolutionary situation” in interviews with 
.
Hundreds of yellow vests continue to block the petrol storage depot at Le Mans. Petrol stations in Brittany have run out of petrol because the depots at Lorient and Brest remain blocked by construction workers in league with yellow vests.
The May ’68 revolt, when France last descended into anarchy, is a widespread reference. “I want another May ’68,” said a roofer who came to repair a leak in this correspondent’s apartment. “But this time, I want us to go all the way. Last time, we were had.”
Lycée students who oppose educational reforms have joined the protests. They clashed with police in the streets of Dijon, Clermont- Ferrand and Aubervilliers on Monday. Classes were disrupted in 100 schools across France.
The prime minister invited representatives of the yellow vests to meet with him on Tuesday, for the second time. Last week, only two representatives showed up, and one left immediately when Philippe refused to allow him to broadcast the meeting live on social media.
Leaders of the amorphous group are divided between those who want to talk to the government and those who refuse. We will not go because the ministers have already said they will not change course,” Cédric Guémy, the spokesman for the “free yellow vests” of the Paris region told France Inter radio.
But another spokesman, 
, said he will go to the prime minister’s office “because I am brave, although it is dangerous for us”. Several representatives of the yellow vests said they received death threats via social media or on their mobile telephones.

A Gulf Arab summit called for regional unity as 
 and Qatar traded barbs over the Qatari emir’s decision not to attend the gathering in 
 on Sunday in a sign that a row between Doha and its neighbours is still festering.
Qatar sent its state minister for foreign affairs to the annual one-day summit, which was overshadowed by the economic and diplomatic boycott of Doha since mid-2017 by Saudi Arabia, the 
, Bahrain and 
 over allegations Doha supports terrorism, which Qatar denies.
“Qatar’s emir should have accepted the fair demands (of the boycotting states) and attended the summit,” Bahraini foreign minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed al-Khalifa said in a tweet.
In response, Ahmed bin Saeed al-Rumaihi, director of the information office at Qatar’s foreign ministry, said: “Qatar can make its own decisions and had attended [last year’s] 
 summit while the leaders of the boycotting countries did not.”
He later slammed the final communique for not addressing the boycott, which Qatar says aims to curtail its sovereignty.
The Gulf Co-operation Council’s (GCC) summit of six member states was held as Riyadh faces international pressure over the October 2nd murder of journalist 
 at the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate.
Saudi Arabia’s King Salman opened the gathering, urging fellow member states Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, the UAE and Qatar to maintain a united front against Iran and terrorism.
“This requires all of us to maintain our countries’ gains and to work with our partners to preserve security and stability in the region and the world,” he said in a speech.
The leaders sat around a table in awkward silence at the close before a bland final communique was read out, stressing the importance of maintaining GCC unity in the face of threats to regional stability and to meet economic challenges.
The UAE will host the next summit in 2019.
Doha last week abruptly announced it was exiting the oil exporters’ group 
 after 57 years to focus on gas, in an apparent swipe at the bloc’s de facto leader Saudi Arabia. 
Riyadh has resisted US pressure to restore ties with Doha following Khashoggi’s murder, an act that drew condemnation and scrutiny of the kingdom’s assertive regional policies.
Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir reiterated in a press conference after the summit that Doha must meet the boycotting states’ demands and that the dispute would not affect military co-operation.

 is under growing pressure to postpone Tuesday’s vote on her Brexit deal and to attempt to persuade the 
 to renegotiate it. Brexit secretary 
 said on Sunday that the vote would go ahead as planned, despite the fact that dozens of Conservative MPs have said they will vote against the prime minister’s deal. “The vote is going ahead and that’s because it’s a good deal and it’s the only deal,” Mr Barclay told the BBC. 
Some Conservatives fear that pressing ahead with the vote will lead to a crushing defeat for Mrs May which could doom her Brexit deal and her premiership. Former foreign secretary 
 said on Sunday that the prime minister should insist that Britain be able to unilaterally end the 
 backstop. “Is it possible for us to reword this Northern Ireland Protocol, the 174-pages, so as it give the UK a unilateral exit mechanism? Yes, it is. And indeed the UK drafted such proposals but then failed to table them. That is the way to go,” he said. 
Mr Johnson refused to promise that he would not seek to replace Mrs May as prime minister, joining two other former ministers, Esther McVey and 
, who declined to rule out a bid for the Conservative leadership. Mr Raab, who resigned as Brexit secretary last month, claimed that the European Commission’s secretary general 
 wanted to make Northern Ireland the price for Britain leaving the EU. “You would hear swirling around in 
, particularly people around Selmayr . . . that losing Northern Ireland would be the price the UK would pay for Brexit. This was reported to me through the diplomatic channels,” he told Sky News. 
Mr Raab said that leaving the EU without a deal was better than accepting Mrs May’s Brexit deal but he said she could stay on as prime minister even if she loses Tuesday’s vote. He said she could return to Brussels and tell the other 27 EU member states she wanted to renegotiate the deal. “If parliament has voted the deal down I think she can go and say this deal doesn’t work for the 
, ” he said. 
Former Conservative attorney 
 Grieve, who wants a second referendum on Brexit, warned on Sunday his party could split over the issue and find itself unable to continue in its current form. “I can see that this is of such a fundamental character, this issue, that it may be the end of the Conservative Party in its current form, and that bothers me very much because one of the products of Brexit has been total paralysis on virtually every other area of policy,” he said. In central London on Sunday, anti-fascist demonstrators massively outnumbered those at a “Brexit betrayal” march led by Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a far-right figure who styles himself 
. 
Elsewhere in London, the former Conservative deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine told supporters of a second referendum that opposing Brexit was an act of patriotism: “Let us make our position clear. We are the British patriots. We want a Britain at the heart of 
 because we want the voice of Britain, the tolerance of Britain, the culture of Britain, at the heart of Europe. We are proud of our Commonwealth and empire. Our voice is their voice in Europe. It is the Brexiteers who seek to belittle us, to undermine our influence, to slam windows, to close doors with the suggestion that our membership of the European community blunts our influence.”

US senators blasted Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday after receiving a classified briefing from CIA director 
 on the death of dissident journalist 
.
The director of the US intelligence services met with senior members of the US senate in a private room in the basement of the US Capitol for a classified briefing after senators complained that she was not present last week at a briefing given to them by secretary of state 
 and defence secretary 
.
Ms Haspel travelled to 
 last month in the wake of the Mr Khashoggi’s killing.
Speaking after the hour-long meeting with Ms Haspel, several senators said they believed that the 33-year-old crown prince was responsible for the murder of the Saudi journalist, who was killed and dismembered after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2nd.
Their findings put the senate at odds with the 
, which has said there is no conclusive proof that the Saudi crown prince ordered the murder of the prominent journalist.
Republican senator Lindsey Graham, the most vocal critic of 
 since Mr Khashoggi’s murder despite being an ally of US president Donald Trump in recent months, said he could no longer support US arms sales to Saudi Arabia while the current leadership is in charge.
“You have to be wilfully blind not to come to the conclusion that this was orchestrated and organised by people under the command of MBS,” the South Carolina senator said, using the crown prince’s initials.
While there was no “smoking gun” he said, there was a “smoking saw”, referring to the weapon that was allegedly used by the assassins in the Istanbul consulate.
Making a distinction between Saudi Arabia and the crown prince, 
 said while Saudi Arabia was a “strategic ally”, the relationship was not worth saving “at all costs”.
Mohammed bin Salman was “crazy,” “dangerous” and a “wrecking-ball” who had put Riyadh’s relationship with the 
 at risk, he said.
, another Republican and the outgoing chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, said he believed the crown prince had “ordered and monitored” the killing of Mr 
. “If he was in front of a jury, he would be convicted in 30 minutes,” Mr Corker said of the crown prince.
It was not clear what legislative measures congress would now consider to respond to a strengthening conviction among key senators that the Saudi leadership ordered the murder of the 
 contributor.
While the US has placed sanctions on the 17 individuals who are alleged to have carried out the murder in the consulate, it has refrained from other measures, such as a halt on arm sales to Saudi Arabia or a reassessment of US support for the Saudi-led efforts in 
. Mr Graham suggested he would favour backing a call to stop arm sales.
 and his senior officials had said there was no conclusive evidence of the crown prince’s involvement in the murder. This puts the White House at odds with the CIA.
While the agency has not spoken publicly on the matter, there have been several reports that the CIA believes the Saudi crown prince was most likely involved in the killing, a position backed up by a series of text messages agents intercepted between the Saudi crown prince and an aide.
As the bipartisan group of senators was being briefed by the CIA director, Mr Trump’s national security adviser, 
, told the attendance at an event in Washington that while the murder of Khashoggi was “a heinous crime”, “it’s a region where a lot of heinous crimes are committed – by 
, by the Assad regime by terrorists all around. So it’s not a case of saying ‘well, this is very distasteful’ ”.

Protest riots on the fourth consecutive Saturday in France were more scattered and possibly less violent, but turnout and destruction were nonetheless significant, despite the doubling of security forces.
Eight-nine thousand police and gendarmes were deployed, including 8,000 in Paris, where the para-military gendarmerie used armoured vehicles to protect the Arc de Triomphe and dismantle barricades erected by protesters.
An estimated 136,000 
 or “yellow vests” demonstrated across the country on December 8th, the same number as the previous Saturday. The interior ministry said 1,723 people were arrested, of whom 1,220 were charged, mostly with preparing violent acts against persons or property. Two-hundred and sixty-four people were injured.
In Paris, security forces matched protesters nearly one to one. Protesters arriving in the capital were searched. Protective goggles and gas masks were confiscated. Police seized hammers, baseball bats, bowling balls and knives.
Protesters and anarchist vandals constituted small, mobile groups which dispersed when attacked with tear gas and moved around the capital despite the public transport shutdown. They smashed windows, burned cars and looted. 
The yellow vests have begun planning “Act V” of their protests for next Saturday.
President Emmanuel Macron will discuss measures of appeasement with social partners on Monday morning and make a televised address on Monday evening.

 is poised to announce his replacement for 
 as White House chief of staff as he prepares for the conclusion of the Russia investigation led by special prosecutor 
. 
Mr Trump at the weekend said Mr Kelly was a “great guy” but that the retired general would leave the position this month. “John Kelly will be leaving toward the end of the year,” said Mr Trump, who added that he would announce his replacement over the next few days.
Mr Kelly’s departure – the latest from an administration in which there has been heavy turnover – comes as Mr Trump faces mounting scrutiny over his ties to Russia and possible campaign finance violations during the 2016 campaign.
On Friday, Manhattan prosecutors said 
, a one-time lawyer for Mr Trump, took actions during the 2016 race ordered by Mr Trump that were aimed at influencing the outcome of the election.
In a court filing, Southern District of New York prosecutors said Mr Cohen had paid two women –porn star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal – to stop them from publicly claiming that they both had sexual relationships with Mr Trump at a time when he was married.
“As Cohen himself has now admitted, with respect to both payments, he acted in co-ordination with and at the direction of Individual-1,” said the prosecutors, adding that he “sought to influence the election from the shadows”.
Experts had said that “Individual-1” was a reference to the president, but the prosecutors wrote explicitly for the first time that it was a reference to Mr Trump – linking him directly to a felony.
In a separate court filing, Mr Mueller said Mr Cohen had met with his investigators seven times and had provided information that was “core to its investigation”. One of the revelations outlined in the document was that a Russian national contacted Mr Cohen in November 2015 to suggest a meeting between Mr Trump and Russian president 
 that was pitched as a way to help the then-real estate mogul build a Trump Tower in Russia.
Mr Trump has long denied any relationship with Russia and describes the Mueller investigation as a “witch hunt”. But the filings showed there have been more ties between Trump campaign officials and Russia than the president has accepted. Mr Trump responded by tweeting, “Totally clears the President. Thank you!”
Democrats leapt on the court filings, saying they provided more evidence that Mr Trump had taken actions that could justify impeachment. 
, a New York Democrat who will chair the House judiciary committee from January, said Mr Trump had committed “impeachable offences”.
“They would be impeachable offences. Whether they are important enough to justify an impeachment is a different question,” he told CNN.
Mr Nadler said the filings showed Mr Trump had been “at the centre of a massive fraud” against the American people, and that the House, which will switch to Democratic control in January, would investigate the matter.
, a Democratic senator from Connecticut, said the filings – which said Mr Trump ordered Mr Cohen to make the payments – showed the investigation had “moved into a new phase” putting Mr Trump in more jeopardy. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018

Britain’s prime minister 
 faces a defining 48 hours for her 
 plans as MPs threaten a huge defeat for the embattled Conservative leader if her deal with the EU is voted on in the House of Commons on Tuesday.
Ms May spoke to Taoiseach 
 by telephone on Sunday at her request, but Government Buildings was tight-lipped about the details of the call, issuing only a short statement afterwards. 
“They discussed the current situation on Brexit, including the planned vote in Westminster on Tuesday,” it said. “They also discussed preparation for this week’s 
 and looked forward to seeing each other in 
 on Thursday.” 
Speaking after the call, one senior source said that there was absolutely no change to the Irish position on the treaty. “Everything is exactly as it was before,” the source said. 
Senior 
 sources insist they would consider a statement from EU leaders to give some comfort to Ms May if she sought one at this week’s summit, but categorically ruled out reopening the withdrawal treaty. 
Irish officials are emphatic that Dublin will not accept any reopening of the negotiations on the treaty and there has been no sign that other EU countries would seek to pressure 
 to do so.
Ms May also telephoned European Council president 
, who chairs the group of EU heads of government. He later tweeted that it would be “an important week for the fate of Brexit”. 
The withdrawal treaty provisions on the Irish backstop – a guarantee that no hard border will return in Ireland, irrespective of the future trade deal between the EU and the UK – continue to arouse fierce opposition in London, with many Tory MPs warning the UK could be compelled to remain under EU rules indefinitely. 
On Sunday, leading Brexiteer 
 said Ms May should demand that the UK should be able to unilaterally end the backstop. 
Reports in London suggested that Ms May was preparing to call off tomorrow’s House of Commons vote and would instead fly to Brussels to seek to persuade EU leaders to make changes to the agreement. However, her Brexit secretary 
 yesterday ruled out that option, saying it would go ahead “because it’s a good deal and it’s the only deal”. 
EU leaders have repeatedly said that after two years of negotiation, this is the only deal on offer. 
As many as 100 Tory MPs are said to be preparing to vote against Ms May’s deal. In a febrile atmosphere in Westminster, Tory MPs were warned 
 leader 
 could be prime minister by Christmas if the deal was defeated.
Some media reports said Ms May would immediately call a confidence vote if her proposals are defeated, and the parliament would sit over Christmas. Others said several more ministerial resignations were likely this week. 
Meanwhile, Tánaiste 
 will also be in Brussels on Monday to attend a meeting of fellow EU foreign affairs ministers. Though Brexit is not on the formal agenda for the meeting, it is likely that ministers will discuss the situation in London, and future contingencies, on the margins of the meeting. 
EU leaders will meet for their end-of-year summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday.

Police in 
 have detained one of the leaders of the gilets jaunes anti-government movement for organising an unauthorised protest, as authorities adopt a tougher approach to try to curb demonstrations by the movement.
The arrested man, 
, a lorry driver, already faces trial in June for “carrying a prohibited category-D weapon”, after he was allegedly found with a wooden stick at a previous protest.
Since November 17th, the gilets jaunes – or “yellow vests”, named after their fluorescent jackets – have regularly held demonstrations that were not declared to the authorities. 
For several weekends, gilets jaunes demonstrations in Paris and other cities such as 
 and 
 saw violent skirmishes with police, as well as banks and shops smashed up and cars burned.
Mr Drouet was arrested by police in Paris on Wednesday night as he was heading towards the Champs-Élysées, where several demonstrators had been waiting for him. 
They said they intended only to light candles for the people injured in demonstrations or killed in road accidents during the six weeks of protests, which took place on roads and roundabouts and began as a fuel-tax revolt but morphed into a movement against the president, 
, and policies seen to favour the rich.
Mr Drouet’s lawyer called the arrest “totally unjustified and arbitrary”. He said Mr Drouet had intended to lay candles at Place de la Concorde in Paris and then meet others in a private place.
France’s minister for the economy, Bruno Le Maire, defended Mr Drouet’s arrest, saying: “It’s called respecting the rule of law . . . It’s normal that when you break the laws of the republic, you face the consequences.”
The authorities now appear to be clamping down on the continuing protests. The interior ministry wrote to local police chiefs this week saying that the rural and suburban roundabouts and toll booths which have been occupied for weeks should be cleared of protesters.
Some said that the arrest of Mr Drouet, often seen on TV as a gilets jaunes spokesman, could turn him into a sort of martyr figure and harden the resolve of demonstrators.
Following the arrest, the leftwing leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a fierce critic of Mr Macron, tweeted: “Again Eric Drouet arrested, why? Abuse of power. A politicised police targeting and harassing the leaders of the yellow vest movement.”
, a gilets jaunes media figure who takes a more moderate line on the protests, said after Mr Drouet’s arrest: “Unfortunately I have the impression that the government wants to radicalise the movement. The executive is pouring oil on the fire. They’ve just put another coin in the jukebox and the gilets jaunes song is going to go on playing, that’s for sure.” – Guardian

French president Emmanuel Macron has called on the nation to unite and cease “hateful” attacks during protests.
Mr Macron also called on people to avoid falling for “false information” online amid anti-government demonstrations that have increasingly turned violent.
The president, went on the offensive in his televised new year’s speech. The counterattack comes amid deteriorating approval ratings which have plummeted in 2018 as he failed to shake the label “president of the rich” and faced an unprecedented citizens’ protest movement
He deliberately did not name the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement that has been demonstrating against the government at road blocks and weekly city centre protests for six weeks. But he criticised what he called a minority who, he said, claimed to be the voice of the people but were in fact “megaphones of a hateful crowd who have lashed out at elected politicians, security forces, journalists, Jews, foreigners, homosexuals”.
Macron said this hatefulness was “the negation of France” and that “our future depends on our capacity to love each other and to love our nation”. He said he had “seen the unthinkable and heard the unacceptable” in recent weeks and that “order” in France would be maintained.
Mr Macron spoke as more than 147,000 security forces were mobilised across the country for New Year’s Eve celebrations, not just because of the terrorist threat in France but also because authorities feared surprise demonstrations by anti-government protesters.
About 300,000 tourists and revellers were expected on the Champs Elysees on New Year’s Eve for Paris’s annual light show, which is projected on to the Arc de Triomphe and was the target of protesters this month. A security cordon was set up around the area from 4pm and guards and police checked those who entered. Some gilets jaunes demonstrators called for peaceful protests in Paris.
Over the past decade, hundreds of cars have been set alight on the edge of French cities including Strasbourg and Lyon on New Year’s Eve in what has become a kind of end-of-year ritual. But officials said security services were on alert for unannounced anti-government protests in order to prevent violence.
The gilets jaunes movement, named after protesters’ hi-vis vests, began in November as a tax revolt against a new fuel duty. It has morphed into a nationwide protest against what has been seen as an unfair and unjust tax policy, and Mr Macron’s measures favouring businesses and the wealthy. Rioting, arson and running battles with police have occurred on the edge of demonstrations in Paris and other cities.
In his new year speech, Mr Macron acknowledged the anger that had spread across France and tried to empathise. But he said it had been brewing for a long time – implying he did not accept the blame but instead laid responsibility on decades of mass unemployment and what he has called years of political stagnation.
Mr Macron tried to channel the positivity of the anger, saying it “showed us that we’re not resigned to anything, that our country wants to build a better future”.
He was careful to use the words “us” and “we” to avoid appearing cut off from the public mood. After he was mocked for the staid style of a recent televised speech aimed at calming the protests, which was delivered seated at a desk in a gilded room, this time Mr Macron stood up in a more modern room in the Elysee Palace.
After some in Mr Macron’s shrinking supporter base feared he would step back from his manifesto promise of structural reforms because of the unrest, the president went on the offensive, vowing to press on with his plans to overhaul the social welfare state and social protection in 2019, beginning with changes to unemployment benefits.
He said of his changes so far, including loosening of labour laws: “The results can’t be immediate, and impatience – which I share – can’t justify any kind of giving up.”
He repeated his argument that unbridled, lawless “ultra free-market” capitalism was at its end, suggesting he wanted to reinvent a new form of responsible globalisation in a Europe that “protects”.
Mr Macron said one of his key wishes for 2019 was “truth”, including a fight against inaccurate information online. This suggested that he might seek to go further on regulating information online, after his government passed a law which aims to empower judges to order the immediate removal of news deemed as fake during election campaigns. He did not give details.
Gilets jaunes demonstrators have called for referendums and a greater role for citizens in everyday politics. Mr Macron said “our institutions must continue to evolve” but didn’t spell out any possible changes to the political system. He has promised to launch a national debate from January and said only that he would write to citizens to set out the parameters in coming days.
The European elections in May will be a major test for Mr Macron’s political party, La Republique En Marche, which is behind Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally in the polls. Mr Macron said in his speech that he would soon set out a project for Europe.
He is also again under pressure over the scandal of his former bodyguard and security aide, Alexandre Benalla, who was sacked this summer after he was filmed acting violently to demonstrators.
The Benalla affair was back in the headlines this week over the former aide’s continuing use of diplomatic passports. He also claimed he had remained in personal contact with Mr Macron. The affair has proved damaging in part because of the Elysee’s botched handling of it, making statements that were contradicted and giving the impression of a cover-up. The Elysee on Monday dismissed his claims as invented. – Guardian

Rioters in Paris torched motorbikes and set barricades ablaze on the upmarket Boulevard Saint-Germain on Saturday, as “yellow vest” protesters returned to the streets to demonstrate against high living costs and the perceived indifference of president 
.
The latest “yellow vest” street marches began peacefully in the French capital but degenerated in the afternoon as protesters threw missiles at riot police blocking bridges over the Seine river.
Officers fired tear gas to prevent protesters crossing the river and reaching the National Assembly. One riverboat restaurant was set ablaze in the unrest, and a policeman was wounded when he was struck by a bicycle hurled from a street above the riverbank.
Two months after they started blocking roads, occupying highway tollbooths and staging sometimes-violent street protests in Paris, the “yellow vest” demonstrators wanted to inject new momentum into their movement, which had weakened over the holidays.
Mr Macron’s government, shaken by the unrest, had this week hardened its stance against the uprising, branding the protesters as agitators seeking to overthrow the government.
Driving the unrest is anger, particularly among low-paid workers, over a squeeze on household incomes and a belief that Mr Macron is deaf to citizens’ needs as he enacts reforms seen as favouring the wealthy.
“They have no right to leave us in the shit like this,” said protester 
 in Paris. “We’re fed up with having to pay out the whole time, we’ve had enough of this slavery, we should be able to live on our salaries.”
There were similar protests in other cities across 
 on Saturday, including in 
, 
, 
 and 
.
An estimated 25,000 took to the streets nationwide in what was dubbed Act VIII of the “yellow vests” movement, BFM TV reported, barely 10 per cent of the number in the first weeks of protests, but higher than the figure for last weekend.
As darkness fell, officers dispersed scores of protesters gathered on the Champs-Élysées. Television images showed hooded youths setting a car alight on a side street, but there was no repeat of the damage done during the protests in late November, when shops were looted, banks were vandalised and the Arc de Triomphe was defaced.
Authorities have blamed the worst of the violence in recent weeks on anarchists, anti-capitalists and extreme groups on the fringes of the “yellow vest” movement.
The protests come 18 months into Mr Macron’s tenure and amid his drive to reshape the economy. They have already forced concessions from the 41-year-old president.
Last month, Mr Macron promised tax cuts for pensioners, wage rises for the poorest workers and the scrapping of planned fuel tax increases to quell the unrest, at a cost to the state of €10 billion.
The announcement marked the first big U-turn for a president elected on a platform of breaking with traditional French politics and liberalising the heavily-regulated economy.
Faced with record-low popularity ratings, Mr Macron is expected to pen a letter soon to the nation setting out his plans for the coming months. These include a nationwide debate with citizens on ecological, fiscal and institutional questions, the results of which he promises will feed into the policy-making process. – Reuters

“Death to the bourgeois state,” says graffiti left by 
 rioters next to a friend’s front door. My apartment looks on to the government ministry that was invaded by insurgents driving a hijacked forklift truck on January 5th.
The protest movement turned insurrection has come too close for comfort.
I returned from a year-end holiday to find my neighbourhood in central Paris transformed. “The Future”, says graffiti on a shop in the boulevard St Germain, next to the circular A symbol of anarchy.
The windows of my local Société Générale bank are shattered.
The Banque Nationale de Paris protected its windows with plywood, on which the rioters listed the bank’s supposed sins, including “climaticide” and fomenting war in Sudan.
Broken glass carpeted the street outside the cafe where I ate my first 2019 meal in Paris. I walked home past a scorched motorcycle, lying like a dead insect in front of Yves Saint Laurent headquarters.
My Spanish concierge was traumatised by watching rubbish bins burning on the corner.
My newspaper vendor said the
 went on the rampage in our neighbourhood because they were pushed this direction by security forces.
Most days, I go outside to find dozens of police vans lined up in surrounding streets. It’s like living in an armed camp.
When the protests started in November, shops and banks would put plywood sheets over their windows late on Friday, then remove them on Sunday.
Now they leave the protective siding in place, giving central Paris the allure of a shanty town.
On December 29th, turnout for the protests dwindled to 12,000 nationwide. Many heaved a sigh of relief in the mistaken belief that the 
 (yellow vest) movement had been defused by president Emmanuel Macron’s promise of €10 billion to increase purchasing power.
But on January 5th, 50,000 
 came back with a vengeance. The demonstrations have morphed from a protest at (now cancelled) fuel taxes to a seditious movement that is determined to bring down the government.
Prime minister 
 announced on Monday night that he will deploy 80,000 police and gendarmes for “Act 9” on January 12th.
But will hardcore anarchists and vandals really be deterred by legislation that would create a register for violent demonstrators, similar to the one for football hooligans?
One of the most shocking images from the January 5th riots showed 
 (37), a former boxing champion, kicking a policeman on the ground on the Solferino footbridge over the Seine, and pummelling another policeman in the face.
Dettinger had “liked” a photograph of Marion Maréchal, the rising star of the French far right, on his Facebook page. He risks five years in prison and a €75,000 fine.
His supporters raised €117,000 for his defence by Tuesday morning, before the crowdfunding  platform Leetchi closed the fund down. A similar fund, set up for the 1,050 police who have been wounded in riots, raised far less.
In the old 
 television show, the puppet version of former Trotskyist leader 
 promised in a soft voice to “string the bourgeois up by their entrails”.
At three Christmas dinners I attended in Paris, I detected a frisson of fear in the French bourgeoisie, a premonition that we’d all be strung up.
Virtually everyone I know likes Macron and detests the 
. I could not understand why polls showed such high support for the protesters, until a colleague reminded me that in Paris, Macron won 90 per cent of the vote in the 2017 presidential election.
Bourgeois means, literally, town-dweller. Most of the 
 are from the neglected countryside.
Not by chance, they are attacking Paris, seat of the hated government, home to the ruling elite.
On Monday, 
, the leader of the populist Italian Five Star movement, urged the gilets jaunes, “Don’t let up!” His partner in government, 
, the head of the extreme right-wing League, expressed his support for “honest citizens who are protesting against a president ruling against his own people”.
, the leader of the far-right 
 (RN), formerly Front National, and an ally of Salvini, is the Chesire cat of the gilets jaunes movement. She is almost invisible, except for her smile.
The demands made by RN in a statement this week are virtually identical to those of the gilets jaunes: the dissolution of the 
 and new elections based on proportional representation, which would probably hand the RN a third of the seats in the French legislature.

Police in Paris fired water cannon and tear gas to repel gilets jaunes (yellow vest) demonstrators from around the Arc de Triomphe monument on Saturday.
This is the ninth straight weekend of protests against French president Emmanuel Macron’s economic policies. Thousands of protesters also marched noisily but peacefully through the Grands Boulevards shopping area in northern Paris. This is close to where a gas explosion in a bakery killed three people, including two firefighters, and injured nearly 50 early on Saturday.
The centre city was in lockdown against another feared eruption of violence by radical elements in the gilets jaunes movement. Bridges across the Seine river closed and official buildings such as parliament and the Elysee presidential palace are protected by police barriers.
Groups of protesters also gathered on and around Paris’s famous Champs Elysees boulevard, the scene of disturbances in recent weeks, many of them calling loudly for Mr Macron’s resignation.
“Macron, we are going to tear down your place!” read one banner.
Around the 19th-century Arc de Triomphe at the top of the Champs Elysee, riot police unleashed water cannon and tear gas at protesters after being pelted with stones and paint, said witnesses.
By mid-afternoon there had been no major clashes with police unlike in previous weeks. In Paris more than 50 people were arrested, some for carrying objects that could be used as weapons.
There were also thousands of marches in the cities of Bordeaux and Toulon in southern France as well as Strasbourg in the east and the central city of Bourges.
Bourges authorities said nearly 5,000 gilets jaunes stuck to the designated demonstration area. But another 500 had pushed into the city centre that was off limits for demonstrators.
Many businesses in Bourges had been boarded up up to avoid damage from protesters. And authorities had removed street furniture and building site materials that could be used for barricades.
In Strasbourg, up to 2,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the European Parliament building and later marched to the centre of the city on the Rhine river border with Germany. Protesters set garbage bins ablaze and police fired tear gas grenades, but no serious violence or looting was reported.
More than 80,000 police were on duty for the protests nationwide, including 5,000 in Paris.
The gilets jaunes take their name from the high-visibility jackets they wear at road barricades and on the street. Their rage stems from a squeeze on household incomes and a belief that Mr Macron, a former investment banker regarded as close to big business, is indifferent to their hardships.
Mr Macron, often criticised for a monarchical manner, is to launch a national debate on January 15th in an attempt to mollify the gilets jaunes, whose unrest has shaken his administration.
The debate, to be held on the internet and in town halls, will focus on four themes: taxes, green energy, institutional reform and citizenship. But aides to Mr Macron have said changing the course of his economic changes aimed will be off limits. – Reuters

French media and reporters’ organisations on Sunday denounced attacks on journalists by “yellow vest” anti-government protesters and called for better protection after a series of incidents this weekend.
Paris police fired water cannon and tear gas to push back demonstrators from around the Arc de Triomphe monument on Saturday, in the ninth straight weekend of protests against French president Emmanuel Macron’s economic reforms.
Journalists covering the protests are increasingly becoming a target for the demonstrators.
In the western city of 
, LCI television reporters were attacked by a group of protesters. One of the security agents working with the TV crew was beaten while he was on the ground and had his nose broken, with footage of the incident widely shared on social media.
In Paris, an LCI reporter was pushed to the ground as demonstrators tried to take away her camera, the station said, adding that it will take legal action against the attackers.
Several other stations, including BFM TV and franceinfo, on Sunday showed images of reporters being hassled or pushed around during Saturday’s yellow vest marches.
Reporters without Borders secretary-general 
 called on authorities to take action.
“This is anti-democratic blackmail from people who consider they can beat up journalists if they disagree with the way events are covered,” he said on 
 Info radio.
Interior minister 
 said on Twitter that anyone attacking reporters will be brought to justice.
“In our democracy, the press is free . . . attacking journalists is attacking the right to inform,” he said.
France has been rocked by yellow vest protests against Macron’s reforms since the middle of November in a movement that has no designated leaders and is not linked to political parties or unions.
Started as a protest against high fuel prices, the movement has morphed into a fight for social justice and more direct democracy. Several demonstrations have degenerated into violent clashes with police.
Over the coming week, Macron will launch three months of national debate to air yellow-vest grievances in the hope of appeasing the movement, which has undermined his authority and upended his reform drive.

Though it started as a protest over fuel taxes, the still simmering 
 revolt in 
 quickly morphed into anger over income inequality and social injustice.
Yet paradoxically, the French government is one of the world’s leading redistributors of wealth and social injustice is less than in other developed countries.
 magazine and 
 newspaper have in recent days published in-depth dossiers on the question. They cited studies by the French statistical institute 
 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which found that income inequality is relatively low in France. And there is less poverty in France than elsewhere in the EU.
Economists measure income inequality by the Gini coefficient, where zero would mean complete equality. France’s Gini coefficient of 0.289 compares favourably with inequality in the UK (0.351) and the US (0.391). Contrary to popular perception, inequality is not increasing, but stagnating, in France. And it is dramatically lower than 50 to 100 years ago.
Likewise, statistics show that purchasing power too has stagnated, not decreased, over the past decade, except for brief periods in 2012 and 2013. However, Insee admits, the cost of basic necessities has risen, especially for the poorest, which sometimes gives the impression the statistics are lying.
Only the wealthiest 43.14 per cent of French households pay income tax, and France has the highest rate of payroll deductions in the world. Yet “make the rich pay” is a constant cry of the 
’.
Insee reported in October that the richest 10 per cent of the French paid 70 per cent of all income tax collected in 2017, or €55 billion out of €78 billion.
Before income redistribution, the average income of the 20 per cent of wealthiest households was 8.4 times the average income of the poorest 20 per cent.
After redistribution, the richest were only 3.9 times better off than the poorest, Insee reported. Government payments, including housing subsidies and social welfare, accounted for two-thirds of the reduction in inequality, while income tax accounted for the other third.
However, the  French are less socially mobile and less equal in opportunity than citizens of other developed countries. It takes six generations for the offspring of a poor French family to reach median income, compared to four to five generations in other OECD countries.  
In 2017, France ranked eighth among 28 EU countries, with 14 per cent of the population, or 8.8 million people, living in poverty, according to a chart published by 
. 
 ranked 11th, with 15.6 per cent in poverty, while 
 was 15th, with 16.1 per cent, and the UK was 17th, with 17 per cent.
The French far right and far left claim that ordinary French people are victims of “ultra liberal” government policies that have led the state to disengage from the economy.
In fact, 
 reports, “The weight of the state has never been greater in the economic life of the country.” Over the past 30 years, public spending has tripled, from the equivalent of €416 billion in 1987 to €1,294 billion in 2017. As a percentage of GDP, government spending has risen from 50 to 57 per cent of GDP, the highest in the OECD and, according to some sources, the highest in the world.
Social protection has risen from 24.5 per cent of French GDP in 1959 to 32 per cent – also the highest in the OECD – in 2016. Between 1980 and 2017, the number of civil servants rose from 3.86 million to 5.66 million.
When President 
 addressed his compatriots in a letter announcing a national debate earlier this month, he said, “France is not like other countries. The sense of injustice is more intense than elsewhere. The demand for mutual assistance and solidarity is greater.”
One can only speculate why a generous welfare state has engendered the most persistent anti-government protests in 
. The different attitude cited by Macron, coupled with a revolutionary tradition, has something to do with it. Fears that Macron’s reforms would alter the system also played a part. As the 19th century philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville observed, the most dangerous moment for a government is usually when it begins to reform.

 crisis, which has seen two months of demonstrations and rioting. For more than six hours in the gymnasium of the small town of Grand Bourgtheroulde, the debate ranged from gripe session to lesson in participative democracy. The president addressed every issue that ails 
.
At moments of virulent criticism, Mr Macron’s jaw clenched. He took notes atop a bound 
 comprising complaints filed by 110 citizens, a gift from the local mayor. Each time the mayors finished speaking, Mr Macron Macron revisited the points they raised, with energy, humour and wonkish precision.
At the outset, Mr Macron listed four “fractures” facing France: social, territorial, economic and democratic.
The term “social fracture” was first used by former president 
 25 years ago, Mr Macron noted. “The territorial fracture continues to grow. Big cities suck up more and more wealth . . . The economic fracture has hit the middle classes.”
Mr Macron traced the “democratic fracture” to 2005, when France voted No to the European constitutional treaty, but the treaty was nonetheless ratified by parliament.
“We must refuse violence, because nothing comes of it,” Mr Macron continued. “We must refuse demagogy, because adding up anger never created a solution . . . Tell me what’s on your minds and in your hearts.”
Some mayors were nervous as they read pre-prepared texts. Others were accomplished orators. “We’ll talk as long as the president can stand it,” said Jean-Paul Legendre, the president of the association of mayors of the Eure department.
“I pass about 30 speed radars each day,” Mr Legendre continued. “It’s oppressive. Let us live a little.” He complained that the central government “crushes proximity” by forcing small towns and villages to regroup in larger entities.
Mr Macron laughed heartily when Mr Legendre accidently referred to the ISF, the wealth tax that 
 rebels want to see reinstated, instead of referring to the DGF for subsidies from the central government. The following speaker, Valéry Beuriot, mayor of Brionne, told Mr Macron he must resolve the “contradiction” between his promise to “put everything on the table” and his refusal to consider re-establishing the ISF.
Other mayors demanded an end to “medical desertification”, as well as access to high-speed internet and more means of transport in the countryside. “We have all felt [your] contemptuousness,” said an articulate mayor of a small town. “I didn’t go to the ENA, so I don’t know everything,” she continued, alluding to the training ground for France’s elite which Mr Macron attended.
On his way to Grand-Bourgtheroulde, Mr Macron stopped at the town hall in Gasny, a commune with a population of 3,000. “We are going to help people in difficult situations take responsibility for themselves,” Mr Macron said away from the cameras. “Some make efforts, and some act stupid.”
Mr Macron’s use of the familiar term 
 for “acting stupid” immediately provoked criticism.

While weekly protests by 
 and President Emmanuel Macron’s “great national debate” continue, the minds of French politicians turn increasingly to European parliamentary elections, only four months away.
After 45 minutes of a dull exposé on the restructuring of Macron’s party, 
, its leader, 
, finally got round to the European contest at his first press conference of 2019 on Thursday.
LREM’s main rival will be Marine Le Pen’s far right 
 (RN), which won the previous elections under its former name, Front National. In mid-January, LREM overtook RN in terms of voter intentions.
Guerini alluded to “outside pressures” exerted by Le Pen’s foreign allies, including Donald Trump’s former adviser, 
, and Russian president 
. “People sometimes say we overdramatise what is at stake,” Guerini said. “But this is historic. The day after the election will either be the first day of the unravelling of the EU or the beginning of its reconstuction.”
RN “are the party of lies and imposture”, Guerini said. “We saw it regarding the Marrakesh Pact and the Treaty of Aachen. Their European campaign will be dominated by fake news.”
The French far left and far right falsely claimed that a UN pact on the rights of migrants would open 
 to unlimited immigration, and that the Franco-German treaty signed on Tuesday means France will give Alsace, Lorraine and its seat on the UN Security Council to Germany.
“
 has injected a slow poison into the veins of French democracy,” Guerini continued. “Day after day, she lies shamelessly. The texts are available, but she says they mean exactly the opposite of what they do.”
LREM will create a “riposte cell” to denounce disinformation, which is now called “infox” in France. It will hold weekly briefings.
Guerini accused MEPs from the RN of saying one thing about migration and taxation, then voting the other way in the EU parliament. “Marine Le Pen flaunts her friendship with [the Italian far right leader] 
. He wants France to take more migrants, which is the opposite of Marine Le Pen’s position.”
Guerini said repeatedly that LREM would be “on the offensive”. Yet he refused to call on the party’s 410,000 members to participate in a pro-Macron “republican march for liberties” that is being organised for the Place de la République in Paris at 2pm on Sunday, January 27th. As a result, the march is almost certain to flop. The government too has refused to endorse it.
“Stop the Violence” and 
, the groups organising the march, originally intended to call it “the republican march in support of Emmanuel Macron”. They dreamed of rallying a million people, like the May 30th, 1968 demonstration that ended the 1968 revolution.
“I have not called on 
 [as members of LREM are called] to participate in the demonstration, even if I respect its intentions and its indignation over the violence at the Arc de Triomphe, against police and government buildings,” Guerini said, in reference to the 
 (yellow vests) protests. “But it seems to me it is not the role of LREM to demonstrate when we are in a phase of dialogue, when the national debate is taking hold. I did not want LREM to support one camp against another.”
The 
 have announced they will field a list in the May election, led by 
, a 31-year-old care-giver who has appeared widely in French media during the crisis caused by the protests. Analysts say 
 participation will help Macron’s party, since the protesters are likely to siphon votes from the far right and far left.

 and his pro-business reforms entered a fourth month.
Police fired tear gas and water cannon as the protests turned violent again after weeks of relative calm during marches, which had seen declining numbers of participants.

The authority and competence of President 
 and his interior minister 
 have been called into question after hooligans laid waste to much of the Champs-Élysées on Saturday. It was the worst rioting since last December 1st.
By Saturday night, 280 people had been arrested, 29 members of the security forces and about 60 gilets jaunes or yellow vest demonstrators were injured. Eighty shops, restaurants, newspaper kiosks and a bank were looted and/or set ablaze.

 for weeks with angry protests over president Emmanuel Macron’s rule.
Some 10,000 people turned out for Sunday’s counter-demonstration, a day after an 11th consecutive Saturday of “yellow vest” demonstrations across France that saw sporadic clashes with police.

Mr Bolsonaro said the Cuban doctors were being used as “slave labour” because the Cuban government took 75 per cent of their salaries. He said the programme that began in 2013 could only continue if they got full pay and were allowed to bring their families from

Protest movements in 
 invariably carry echoes of class warfare and the 1789 revolution. The yellow-jacketed gilets jaunes, who managed to mobilise 290,000 people across France on Saturday, without an organisation and without leaders, are no exception.
Though their numbers are dwindling, the gilets jaunes continued to block highways, bridges and fuel depots on Monday, with an ever present threat of violence. A 63-year-old female protester was killed when a motorist tried to drive through a barricade in Savoy on Saturday. A 25-year-old man was seriously wounded when he was run over by a lorry at another barricade early on Monday. More than 500 people have been injured.

The unidentified gunmen shot Raed al-Fares, along with his friend Hamoud al-Juneid, in the town of Kafranbel, home to the Radio Fresh station, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

Amid intense political and diplomatic activity ahead of Sunday’s crucial European summit, British prime minister Theresa May travels to Brussels on Saturday to finalise the agreements on which she has staked her political future and the relationship between the European Union and the UK.
Senior political and official sources in Dublin and Brussels said on Friday night that they expected the summit to adopt both the withdrawal treaty – the legally binding document that will govern the UK’s exit if ratified by the European and British parliaments – and the declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.

As the vote on Theresa May’s 
 deal approached, the atmosphere in the House of Commons was at once anxious and flat, as MPs considered the inevitable result and its unpredictable consequences.
Summing up the debate for the opposition, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary 
 said the mood had been “lively at times but also sombre”.

Something about the president of

Sterling fell more than 1 per cent to 86.45 pence per euro as Geoffrey Cox’s comments damped the prospect of Prime Minister 
 garnering the support of enough lawmakers to back her deal in a vote Tuesday. Gilts erased an earlier decline to gain ground.

Fast-forward 19 months, to December 2018. Macron was booed when he sneaked out of the Élysée Palace to survey the devastation of the Champs-Élysées by rioters, and during a furtive trip to a prefecture they’d set fire to in the Loire. For 10 days, the president hunkered down in the Élysée, pondering where it all went wrong.

Writing of Benito Mussolini’s brand of now-reviving nationalism, the Italian political scientist 
 makes a telling, and not very flattering, comparison with his inheritors in Rome’s government today. They have embarked on a major battle with the EU over what is seen in Brussels as a wildly reckless budget.
Mingardi notes that the dictator made strenuous efforts to balance the country’s budget, not “because he wanted to establish his country as self-sufficient. He was determined to make 
 great again, and he knew that beggars can’t be choosers.

In his first volley of the morning, fired at 6.50am in Washington, Mr Trump implied that the US twice saved

Belgian police fired water cannon and teargas in central Brussels on Friday to drive back protesters inspired by France’s “yellow vest” anti-tax movement who hurled rocks at the prime minister’s office.
Police made dozens of arrests and protesters destroyed at least two police vans as what started as a peaceful but unauthorised demonstration, lacking clear leadership and largely promoted on social media, descended into violence when people, many masked or hooded, tried to breach police lines.

The French political and economic landscape looks like the Champs-Élysées the morning after a riot by the 
, the yellow-vested demonstrators who savaged President Emmanuel Macron’s best-laid plans over the past five weeks.
The movement appears to have subsided for the time being. But the government is bungling its PR. The success of the yellow vests in extracting €10.3 billion in concessions has inspired a money grab. While the Élysée splurges in the name of social peace, prime minister Édouard Philippe clings to the idea of budgetary discipline.

In Paris, police said they had arrested almost 300 people while almost 100 were injured as protesters hurled projectiles at riot officers, burned cars and smashed shop fronts. In some areas, groups of masked men roamed freely, smashing a police van with metal bars and setting trees alight.

A new front has opened up in the conflict between the government of 
 and the Spanish state, after the region’s president, 
, faced legal action for failing to keep official buildings free of symbols associated with the independence movement.
The electoral board has announced it will file a complaint against Mr Torra before the state prosecutor for violating the political neutrality of government buildings.

In approving Theresa May’s request for a short unconditional extension to April 12th EU leaders have effectively done no more than kick the can down the road for a few days. 
The hard decisions will come if and when the House of Commons again votes down the withdrawal agreement between London and 
 in a third “meaningful vote” – now commonly referred to as MV3.

 leaders have agreed to postpone Britain’s departure by almost two months until May 22nd if MPs at Westminster approve British prime minister Theresa May’s 
 deal next week. 
If they fail to do so, Britain will leave the EU on April 12th, just two weeks after the planned exit date of March 29th, unless it chooses to hold 
 elections at the end of May.

French police fired tear gas, stun grenades and water cannon in battles with "yellow vest" protesters trying to breach security cordons on the Champs Elysees in Paris on Saturday (December 1) ahead of a third rally against high living costs.

A crane stacked carcasses of charred cars atop a flatbed lorry on the avenue de la Grande Armée. Green municipal vans with power hoses began a three-day clean-up at the Arc de Triomphe. “The yellow vests will triumph,” graffiti said. “The state. The cops. The fascists,” said the message scrawled under a Circle-A, the symbol of anarchists.
Paris’s triumphal avenues looked like a battlefield on Sunday, following the worst riots in the centre of the capital since the May 1968 revolution. Near the Irish embassy on the avenue Foch, rioters built barricades from tree trunks. In the boulevard Haussmann, they tore municipal bicycles from their stands for the same purpose.

Summing up the EU’s summit in

The Viking Sky sent out a mayday signal on Saturday as it drifted in rough waters in the Norwegian Sea to within 100m of land.

MPs have voted to delay Britain’s departure from the EU by at least three months as talks continue between Theresa May’s government and the DUP in an effort to save the withdrawal agreement. The government’s motion calling for an extension of the article 50 negotiating deadline passed by 412 votes to 202.
But most Conservatives voted against the motion in a free vote that saw eight cabinet ministers including 
 secretary Stephen Barclay oppose it. The prime minister hopes to put the Brexit deal to a third vote in the House of Commons before next Wednesday and if it passes, she will seek a short extension until June 30th to pass implementation legislation.

Speaker 
 said the government could not bring forward proposals for a vote that were substantially the same as had already been defeated twice before, in January and last week.

This comes after EU leaders at Friday’s European summit raised the need to protect the single market if the UK crashes out of the union without a deal. Several senior EU and Irish sources said there was a desire that the issue be prioritised immediately.

he UK voted to leave the European Union on June 23
 2016 by a majority of 51.9 to 48.1 per cent, with a turnout of just under 72 per cent. This set the UK on course to leave the EU, but left all the details of its exit still to be decided. The timetable was set the following March 29th, when British prime minister Theresa May took the formal step, required under EU law to start the exit process, of triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Under the two-year process the UK will leave the EU on March 29
, 2019. An extension to the exit period is possible if all 28 EU members agree. However negotiations have been taking place on the assumption that the UK leaves in March 2019. 
The talks between the UK and EU started in June 2017 and so far have focused on the details of the UK’s withdrawal, which must be set down in a formal, legal agreement. Outline agreement has been reached on what the UK will pay the EU after departure – the so-called exit bill or divorce bill – and on the mutual recognition of the rights of UK citizens in the EU and EU citizens in the UK.
In November, agreement was also reached on a backstop for the Irish border, a way to provide a guarantee that there be no hard border on the island of Ireland no matter what future trade arrangements are agreed between the EU and UK. This cleared the way for a draft withdrawal agreement and final talks on a political declaration outlining the principles for future negotiations. This draft needs to be ratified politically by both sides.
Under the withdrawal agreement, a so-called transition period, a kind of standstill in current arrangements, would apply from March 2019 until December 2020, or 2022 if it is extended. This is to allow future trade arrangements and the wider ongoing relationship between the EU and UK to be negotiated. Read a full 
) . The withdrawal agreement also contains a provision known as the backstop, but more on that later.
or a country to leave the EU is unprecedented ‑ and the extent of the complications has slowly become evident in the last couple of years. EU membership is a central part of the economy and society of all its members and unscrambling this is very complex, before account is even taken of sketching out how the two sides will relate to each other in future.
Much of the discussion has been about the UK’s membership of the EU trading bloc. There are two elements to this. First, the UK is part of the EU customs union. This is a free trade area under which allows goods to circulate freely through the EU. Part of this is a commitment by all members to impose the same import tariffs – or taxes – on goods entering from outside the EU.
The UK is also part of the EU single market, the system of rules and regulations which allow free movement of goods, services, people and capital. Together, membership of the customs union and single market allows goods to move freely across the EU and also for free trade in services like banking. Common EU regulations also underpin trade in a host of different areas, for example pharmaceuticals and food.
The single market also allows free movement of people across the EU. The UK is also involved in common international policies co-ordinated at EU level, notably in foreign policy and defence and in trade deals with other countries.
rexit talks between the UK and the EU are taking place in a sequenced order, which has led to no little confusion in the debate.
What has been agreed are the draft terms on which the UK leaves, contained in the withdrawal agreement. A political declaration on what the future relationship might look like has also been finalised. However, details of the future relationship between the EU and UK will be decided in talks after the UK actually leaves ‑  assuming the two sides are still talking.
In the short term the conclusion of the withdrawal agreement would mean that once the UK leaves in March 2019 a transition period, a kind of standstill, would commence and last until the end of 2020. The draft withdrawal agreement also suggests that this transition period could be extended until 2022. If the agreement is ratified and the transition period kicks in, not much will change on March 29th, except for the UK’s formal departure.
f there is no withdrawal agreement, then the UK would leave the EU in a so-called “no-deal” Brexit in March 2019, which could be chaotic as barriers to trade would go up overnight and there would be uncertainties in areas ranging from aviation to pharmaceuticals to co-operation in nuclear regulation. There is speculation that the EU and UK would work together to try to avoid the worst of the chaos – though they could only do so much ‑  or even that there might be late moves to delay the UK’s exit date.
If a withdrawal agreement is finalised, then talks move on to how the two sides will relate in future in areas such as foreign policy, defence and security and, crucially for Ireland, trade. (Follow 
 would mean for Ireland) 
n terms of trade, the UK could have a close relationship with the EU – like Norway, which follows many EU rules and regulations and is in the single market – or have a free trade deal with the EU, like Canada. (Read our 
) 
The crunch point is that the EU insists that the UK must either be fully in the EU trading bloc and accept all the rules, or be out of it, and have a relationship similar to the EU and Canada. For the UK, the more closely aligned it remains with the EU, the less freedom it will have to set its own economic course after Brexit.
he UK’s departure from the EU means Northern Ireland is leaving the bloc too so checks would be required along the 499-kilometre Irish Border as different trade rules would apply north and south after Brexit. The Border in Ireland will become the only land border between the UK and the EU after Brexit.
The 1998 Belfast Agreement laid the foundation for Northern Ireland’s peace process with many all-island rules and institutions. Neither side wants the return of border checks because of the risk to peace whereby a physical border infrastructure would be considered a potential target for paramilitaries.
The Backstop is an insurance policy that the EU and UK have agreed to include in the withdrawal agreement to avoid this happening. Both sides see it as a last resort to be triggered in the event of no better solution being found to avoid a hard border in a EU-UK trade deal. But there is a sequencing problem: a withdrawal treaty must be agreed before a trade deal, hence the need for the backstop first. (Follow 
)
he economic impact of Brexit is negative, for both the UK, Ireland and the rest of the EU. The biggest impact will be in the UK itself and in Ireland, its closest trading partner.  For the UK, any trade arrangement reached after Brexit – barring full membership of the EU trading bloc, which the UK has ruled out – will be less favourable than current arrangements. Economists say that any new trade opportunities elsewhere will not make up for losses in trade with the EU. Weaker sterling since Brexit has already cut the purchasing power of UK consumers and uncertainty has hit investment, with growth estimated to be 1 to 2 per cent per annum lower over the couple of years.
For Ireland, growth remains strong and the main short-term impact has been via a weaker sterling exchange rate, which is good if you’re going to the UK to buy a second-hand car but bad if you’re an exporter to the UK market. 
The main threat to Brexit comes from barriers to exports to the UK and also delays and higher prices for importers of UK goods to Ireland. Forecasters have estimated that in a harder version of Brexit, where the UK leaves the EU trading bloc, the Irish economy could be 4 to 7 per cent lower in a decade’s time, with most of the hit in the first five years. A no-deal Brexit means the economic effect would be more severe and happen more quickly
Theresa May has scheduled a second “meaningful vote” on her Brexit deal for this date after the UK parliament rejected the withdrawal agreement brokered with the EU by 432 votes to 202 on January 15th.
If May’s deal is rejected by British MPs, the House of Commons will be asked on this date if it supports leaving the EU without a deal on March 29
.
If this vote is rejected, MPs will be asked to vote on a "short, limited extension" to the Article 50 process, delaying Brexit to no later than the end of June, May has said. The Irish Government is targeting the passage of the hard Brexit’ emergency legislation by the Oireachtas by this date.
Brexit - the United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the European Union. If a deal is reached, the 21-month standstill transition period kicks in, maintaining the existing EU-UK relationship while both sides try to hammer out a future trading agreement. 
This is the date that May has said would be the latest date that the Brexit Article 50 process can be delayed until, if MPs reject her divorce deal in the March 12
 vote, reject leaving the EU without a deal on March 13
 and vote for an extension to Article 50 on March 14th.
 Under the draft Brexit agreement, the UK and EU can, before this date, request an extension to the transition period "of up to one or two years to the transition period". 
 If the EU and UK have agreed a Brexit treaty and agree a future trading relationship, this is the earliest date by which the transition period will end. 
 the date the EU’s chief negotiator has proposed extending the Brexit transition to in order to allow the EU and UK negotiate a trading deal. Under the withdrawal agreement this is the latest date on which the transition period can end. If it were extended until 2022 it would mean that the UK would stay within the single market and customs union for six and a half years after the Brexit vote.

So the great 
 clash between economics and politics enters its final, decisive phase. This week’s EU Council didn’t so much kick the can down the road as nudge it on a few yards past the neighbour’s house. Time is still very short. The week ahead is still shaping up as vital, although a little more wriggle room has been left as EU leaders pushed the responsibility right back at the UK.
If the House of Commons rejects the withdrawal agreement, as it well might, then the risk of a no-deal exit is back – just on April 12th instead of March 29th.

As Brexit lumbers on, more and more people have taken to gathering outside parliament in London to make their voices heard on the issue.
Every day, scores of pro and anti-Brexit protesters gather outside parliament. Some put in gruelling eight-hour shifts while others pop by for shorter stints. They wear colourful outfits, chant slogans, and wave flags. The protests are mostly good natured and the two sides keep a healthy distance from each other.

The last time I went to 
 in the west midlands and Reading in the southeast was in 2016, the week before the UK referendum on EU membership, and while some people had strong views then, many seemed strangely disengaged or even apathetic. Now, in contrast, everyone I speak to seems worn out and, in many cases, angry.

 next Friday, with all the disruption that would cause to the UK’s neighbours as well as itself. By the end of the night, that was gone too.
“All they had left was the date. Now we’ve taken that away from them,” a senior EU source said.

Theresa May always made much of her devotion to the cricketer 
. She campaigned unsuccessfully for the former England and Yorkshire batsman to be awarded a knighthood and implicitly compared herself to him: “I have been a Geoff Boycott fan all my life. It was just that he kind of solidly got on with what he was doing.”
But while this idea of modelling herself on Boycott’s dogged, undemonstrative persistence at the wicket seems to capture May’s own qualities, it has one big flaw. Boycott actually scored the runs.

In the votes on marriage equality and abortion in 2015 and 2018 in Ireland, we built movements before the referendums. In Britain, they’re trying to build a movement after a referendum. That is not an easy thing to do.
As the Brexit disaster rumbles on, it would be useful for the UK to look to Ireland for lessons in democracy and public discussion on divisive issues. If we managed to chart a course through two issues that are said to be polarising, and in the end actually acted as forces for unity, how can the UK do the same? Brexit is an absolute calamity, but the destruction it is causing and will continue to cause is not irreparable.

New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced on Monday a royal commission, a powerful form of public inquiry, into the events leading up to a March 15th attack on two mosques in Christchurch that killed 50 people.
“It is important that no stone is left unturned to get to the bottom of how this act of terrorism occurred and what, if any, opportunities we had to stop it,” Ardern told reporters at Parliament House in the capital, Wellington.

US president 
 claimed “complete and total exoneration” after US special counsel 
 concluded there was no conspiracy between the president or members of his circle and 
 in its effort to manipulate the 2016 presidential election. 
Mr Mueller stopped short of exonerating the president on obstruction of justice charges, according to a summary of his findings sent to 
 on Sunday by attorney general 
.

As fire swept through the classroom, the pleas from the 56 girls locked inside began to fade. Most were unconscious or worse by then, as an eerie silence replaced their panic-stricken shouts.
The police officers guarding the door – who had refused to unlock it despite the screams – waited nine minutes before stepping inside. They got water to cool down the scorching knob.

US president 
 is preparing to declare a national emergency to build his proposed border wall with Mexico, setting the White House up for a major constitutional battle with Congress.
In what appears to be an unprecedented move, the president is expected to invoke emergency powers to declare a national emergency over immigration. Mr Trump has consistently described the situation at the United States’ southern border as a national security crisis, arguing that a border wall is needed. But Congress has refused to fund the wall, an impasse which led to last month’s 35 day government shutdown.

US president 
 will almost certainly face legal challenges over his decision to declare a national emergency to get additional funding for a US-
 border wall, circumventing the power of Congress to set spending policy.
Legal scholars say it is unclear how such a step would play out, but they agree a court test would likely focus on whether an emergency actually exists on the southern border and on the limits of presidential power over taxpayer funds.

The Egyptian parliament approved sweeping measures on Thursday that would allow President Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi to extend his leadership until 2034, further entrenching his authoritarian rule and enshrining in law the military’s dominance over the country.
The vote by parliament, whose workings are quietly managed by Mr Sisi’s intelligence agencies, sets in motion a fast-moving process of constitutional change that could culminate in a referendum within three months. The referendum’s approval is seen as a foregone conclusion.

Germany and France defused a growing row on energy policy on Friday with a last-minute compromise over how to regulate a controversial Russian gas pipeline.
But the dissent has revived EU tensions about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, carrying Russian gas under the Baltic Sea to Germany. And it has renewed concerns about the EU’s Franco-German engine, two weeks after their leaders signed a political treaty promising closer bilateral co-operation.

Thousands of riot police and armoured vehicles will be deployed in Paris on Saturday as 
 anticipates a fifth weekend of anti-government protests in the capital and other cities across France.
Despite government pleas for the gilets jaunes – or yellow vest – protesters to call off street demonstrations in the wake of the terror attack in 
, many vowed to continue their struggle. The grassroots protest movement has continued all week on roundabouts and tollbooths and authorities believe Saturday’s street marches in major cities will go ahead.

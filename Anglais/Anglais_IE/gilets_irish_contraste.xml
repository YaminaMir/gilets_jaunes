UN mediator  has informed the Security Council that the pull-out could start this week.There could be delay, however, in implementing the agreement reached last weekend. Houthi spokesman  said the withdrawal would take two days, but the Saudi-backed government insists it would begin only after the sides agree on an authority to secure and operate the ports.Unicef called for “unconditional and sustained humanitarian access to the 135,000 children remaining” in Hodeida city, where they are facing “the highest levels” of malnutrition and cholera in the country. “The children of  have suffered far too long, living in conditions no human being should ever have to bear,” the agency stated, urging implementation of the Hodeida deal and a nationwide ceasefire.Under the UN deal, Houthi fighters have committed to evacuating Hodeida port, which handles 80 per cent of Yemen’s imports, and two smaller ports bringing in grain and oil. Saudi-backed paramilitaries are set to open the highway to the Houthi-held capital, , and pull back from the eastern outskirts of Hodeida city, where fighting raged until a ceasefire was imposed in December. Yemen teeters on the brink of the world’s worst famine in a century.At least 19 million of Yemen’s 28 million people endure different degrees of malnutrition and illness due to four years of violence that has killed about 60,000 people. The UN estimates that 85,000 children have died of starvation and preventable diseases.While the flow of supplies into the country and humanitarian access to all areas are major problems, aid to Yemen could halt by the end of March if agencies remain starved for funds.UN humanitarian chief , who said $4.2 billion is needed for 2019, told the UN Security Council: “Among the many challenges the aid operation faces, funding is quickly becoming the biggest.”The UN-co-ordinated operation involving 250 agencies is the largest in the world.  and Switzerland are hosting a pledging conference next week to raise funds for Yemen.Meanwhile, in Yemen’s north, Houthi fighters have conducted cross-border attacks on Saudi troops. The Saudi air force conducts unhindered air strikes on Houthi-held areas while 14,000 Sudanese mercenaries have been deployed on the ground alongside local militiamen to battle the rebels. The United Arab Emirates employs mercenaries from Latin America,  and .The US, UK and  are among nine countries supplying arms to .  has joined ,  and  in banning the sale of weapons due to the Yemen war.The Saudis and Emiratis launched their 2015 campaign against the Houthis – who are accused of receiving aid from  – with the aim of restoring to power Yemeni president Abd-Rabbu . He was ousted by the Houthis, who demanded a government free from external influence, fair representation in parliament and an end to corruption. Subscribe.    </doc>

Photograph: iStockA challenge to An Bord Pleanála’s decision to approve plans for a 138km north-south electricity interconnector to be built by  has been dismissed by the . The appeal was brought by  Ltd and a local landowner, , following the High Court’s rejection of their challenge to the board’s permission in 2017.The project comprises a 400kV overhead line circuit linking an existing substation in Woodland, Co Meath, with a planned substation in , Co Tyrone. It is planned to provide a second high-capacity all-Ireland interconnector alongside the existing 275kV double circuit overhead line between Co  and Co . In agreeing to hear an appeal over the  decision, the Supreme Court said the case raised issues of public importance. Those included whether  was lawfully designated by the State as a “competent authority” under the 2013 Project of Common Interest EU regulation, and whether its functions in that role created a conflict in respect of its role in approving the proposed development.The State is required under the regulation to designate “one national competent authority” to be responsible for facilitating and co-ordinating the permit-granting process for major projects of common interest. The regulation obliges a project promoter to facilitate public participation and report to the competent authority on the results of that.All five judges agreed, for the reasons set out in a judgment of , the appeal should be dismissed.Responding to the decision, Meath West TD Peadar Tóibín said the interconnector was “a national scandal in slow motion”.“It’s estimated that there is a €30 million cost to the State for every year that the infrastructure is not built. It is now over 10 years old which means that the delay has cost the State €300 million. The delay is a result of the Government’s pig headed determination to overground the project against the wishes of the people of the five counties that it will carve up.”The Government was seeking to construct 409 pylons, up to 51 metres high, carrying 400,000 volts through Meath, Cavan and Monaghan, Armagh and Tyrone, the Aontú leader added.“There are significant fears with regards threats to health especially threats of cancers and childhood leukaemia. There are fears with regards damage to value of homes, farms and business. The tourism, agriculture, the blood stock industry are all extremely alarmed.”The technology was becoming out of date, he said. “Indeed new underground lines with similar distances are being built between Germany and Belgium within budget.”Electricity Association of Ireland chief executive Dara Lynott said it was “great news for businesses and consumers across the island of Ireland. Enhancing our north-south interconnector capacity will facilitate growth in renewable energy generation and bring greater security and resilience of electricity supply for the benefit of all customers.” It would also play a key role in decarbonising electricity in the most cost-effective way. “It is crucial in helping the island of Ireland deliver a low-carbon economy by 2050 and maximising the efficient development of renewable generation.“Approximately 70 per cent of electricity demand on the island lies east of a line from Cork to Belfast. This interconnector will provide the backbone for this corridor, and will increase our price competitiveness and our ability to attract foreign direct investment while delivering reduced costs for customers,” he said.McCann FitzGerald head of environment and panning Brendan Slattery said the State and promoters of the other “projects of common interest” – namely, the proposed Greenlink interconnector (between Ireland and Wales) and the Celtic interconnector to France and the Shannon LNG projects – “can be relieved to see the first of their kind withstand challenge”.The consent for the part in Northern Ireland was quashed last week when a court ruled that only a government minister could grant the consent, but there was currently none in office. Subscribe.    </doc>

He said the Taoiseach had made empty threats in suggesting that electricity could be cut off in Northern  and that he was going to send troops to the border. “That kind of rhetoric has not helped relations between  and the Irish Republic,” he said. Mr Wilson said that he had worked hard within the  to normalise relations between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. “For whatever reason, the current Taoiseach has set relations back by years.” Speaking on the  programme, Mr Wilson said a no-deal scenario will be much more damaging to the Irish economy than to the UK economy. “A small Irish economy will not be able to stand the impact of Britain leaving and the huge imports which Britain brings from Ireland being cut off,” he said. Mr Wilson told the programme that a larger proportion of Irish exports go to Britain than go to the EU. In reality, according to the latest figures from the  (CSO), 11 per cent of Irish exports go to Britain (€14.1 billion). Half (€71 billion) go to the EU. “It just seems absolute madness,” he said. “Your Government has rushed headlong down a route that puts a barrier between not only Northern Ireland and GB which is our main market, but between Ireland and GB, which is your main market.” He predicted that Ireland will be the next small nation in  to suffer the “overbearing power of  and Germany”.  Subscribe.    </doc>

They paid a visit to President Michael D Higgins in Áras an Uachtaráin on Monday evening, and were then greeted by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Farmleigh HouseTánaiste Simon Coveney has hosted a “retreat-style” meeting with foreign ministers from nine countries in an effort to explore new ways to reignite the stalled Middle East peace process. The conference took place in Farmleigh House over two days involving six European countries, Jordan and Egypt and a representative from the Palestinian Authority as well as the secretary general of the Arab League. However, Israel did not participate in the event. In a short statement issued after the meeting, the Government said the group had discussed the present state of the Middle East peace process. “The group shares a vision for peace and re-emphasised the centrality of the resolution of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict on the basis of the two-state solution for regional peace and security,” it said. The conference was private and not publicised in advance. Speaking in advance of the conference, Mr Coveney said the conference originated in a conversation he had with Palestinian foreign minister Riyad Al Maliki in June 2018 about how Ireland could be helpful to the Palestinian Authority in terms of “exploring thinking around the Middle East peace process”. He also said the private nature of the conference could allow more meaningful progress. “Ireland has for some time positioned itself as a country that is deeply interested in the Middle East peace process,” said Mr Coveney. “We have backed resolutions in the United Nations calling for dramatically increased funding to the Palestinian Authority. I have been there, in Palestine and Israel, three times.”He said he wanted to position Ireland as a real influencer “to make real things happen rather than be seen to be a protester on the sidelines. That means bringing key people together [in Dublin]. Sometimes politicians speaking privately together is best in an effort to bring things forward with no fanfare.”In addition to Mr Maliki, the meeting was attended by foreign ministers from Bulgaria, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Jordan, Sweden and Spain, as well as the Arab League. The delegates paid a brief visit to President Michael D Higgins in Áras an Uachtaráin on Monday evening, and were then greeted by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at Farmleigh House. The conference included a working dinner on Monday night and continued until Tuesday afternoon. According to the brief statement, the ministers emphasised support for a comprehensive peace that would meet the legitimate rights and aspiration of both parties: the right of Palestinians to freedom and statehood; and the right of Israelis to security and regional acceptance.“The ministers expressed alarm at the deterioration of the situation. They urged international mobilisation and serious and effective negotiations to create a political horizon for positive momentum so as to counter disillusionment and radicalisation. “Participants reiterated support for every credible effort to get such serious negotiations started. The ministers are committed to do everything they can to make a positive contribution to these efforts,” the statement concluded. Mr Coveney, speaking in Brussels before returning to Dublin for the conference, said “the last 18 months has been a disaster for the peace process” and added that relationships between the Palestinians on the one hand, and the US and Israel on the other hand, were at a low point. Mr Coveney said it was not an EU-Arab summit but was instead an “influential representative group of opinion formers representative a broad perspective”. He said it was not an anti-Israeli alliance rather an “informed and confidential discussion of how we find ways of progressing a peace negotiation again which seems a long way off at the moment”.  Subscribe.

Photograph: Ivor Prickett/The New York TimesShamima Begum left London as a 15-year-old schoolgirl to join Islamic State in . Four years later and with a baby born days ago, .Her case is emblematic of the security, political and legal difficulties facing a clutch of European governments as they debate whether and how to take back hundreds of former Islamic State (also known as Isis) fighters and their supporters.The tensions over how big western European countries deal with Islamist radicals who joined Syria’s civil war are long-standing, but they are being brought to a head in the UK,  and .The catalyst is an offensive by US-backed forces on Isis’s last stronghold in northeastern Syria.It has led Washington and its military allies in Syria and  to step up efforts to move captured foreigners out of former Isis-controlled territory. But European countries are resisting the pressure.France said on Monday that it would take back militants on a “case by case” basis but would not comply with US president Donald Trump’s call at the weekend for European fighters to be repatriated immediately., French justice minister, told France 2 television: “At this stage France is not responding to [Trump’s] demands.”London has taken a hard line on the case of Begum. Sajid Javid, UK home secretary, has said he will “not hesitate” to prevent the return of British nationals who have supported terrorist organisations abroad.“If you do manage to return you should be ready to be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted,” Javid said.On Tuesday the family’s lawyer said . Tasnime Akunjee said the family had received a letter which said Javid had ordered the move and explained it had already been processed.Research in 2016 estimated that between about 3,900 and 4,300 EU member state nationals had become Isis fighters, most of them from the UK, France, Germany and , according to a  report published last year. An estimated 30 per cent had already returned home.Some 1,500 foreign women and children have now reportedly fled to a desert camp outside Isis’s final stronghold in Al-Hasakah province, Syria. More than 40,000 people are living in dire conditions in the Al Hol camp with few other options than to try to go home.The security threat that returnees may pose is a source of mounting concern. , head of MI6, the UK’s secret intelligence service, said last week that they were “likely to have acquired the skills and connections that make them potentially very dangerous”.One estimate is that of about 900 UK nationals who went to join Isis in Syria, a fifth have died, two-fifths have returned, and another two-fifths have yet to come back.Another worry is possible public anger with both returnees and the authorities for allowing them to come back, particularly if they have shown no remorse. Begum has previously told British media she has no regrets about travelling to Syria to join Isis., German government spokesman, said  was co-ordinating with European counterparts as it decided how to handle the “middle two-digit” number of Germans it believed had fought with Isis and were now held by Kurdish forces in northeast Syria.“We have to deal with this because it involves German citizens and we are in close contact on this matter with France and the UK, in particular,” he said, adding that Berlin had also held talks with Washington on the matter.Germany’s domestic intelligence service, the BfV, estimates that since 2013 more than 1,050 Islamists left the country for Iraq and Syria.The BfV has found that about a third of those German Islamists have now returned to Germany, with another 200 thought to have been killed in Syria and Iraq.Of those who have returned, more than 110 played an “active part” in the fighting, and remain “the subject of police and judicial inquiries”, the BfV said in a statement.Trump raised the stakes over the weekend when he threatened to release more than 800 captured foreign Isis fighters if European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, did not take them back and put them on trial.The US-allied Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have complained for months about the burden of holding captured foreign Isis fighters and their families – and Trump’s surprise decision last month to start withdrawing US troops from Syria has further stoked their anxiety.Abdulkarim Omar, co-chair of the SDF’s foreign relations commission, has accused fighters’ foreign countries of origin of trying to “shirk their responsibilities” for people who “may pose serious threats [to] Europe and the international community”.Jean-Yves Le Drian, France’s foreign minister, has previously branded Isis fighters and their wives as “enemies” of France who should stay and face justice in Syria or Iraq.But Younger of MI6 underlined the difficult legal dilemma Britain faces in dealing with returning extremists.“British nationals have a right to come to the UK,” he said last week.European countries are also unwilling to risk the safety of their own officials by sending them to retrieve the Isis fighters and followers from a war zone.If militants do return home, prosecution may be difficult or impossible, even for suspected fighters. Proving specific actions on the battlefield to the standards needed in a European court might be impossible, given the difficulty in securing witness testimony and other evidence.The UK has responded by bringing in a new law this month that makes it a criminal offence to travel to any “designated area”, such as the war zone in Syria, unless the person is engaging in an exempt activity such as humanitarian work or journalism.A further European concern is that if returnees are not prosecuted it is likely to be difficult and expensive to integrate them back into society, protect them from retribution and monitor their activities. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019 Subscribe.    </doc>

Muthana is the only American among an estimated 1,500 foreign women and children inside the sprawling camp of 39,000 people, which is situated about two hours from where a final battle to oust extremists is days from being completed.Her experience in the so-called caliphate tracks the arc of Isis’s rise and collapse over five years. Muthana fled her home and took a flight to Turkey in November 2014 after several months of planning, which she kept secret from her family.She settled into the Syrian city of Raqqa, then one of Isis’s two main hubs – the other being Mosul in Iraq – where she married an Australian jihadist, Suhan Rahman, the first of her three husbands.Rahman was killed in the town of Koban, and soon afterwards Muthana angrily tweeted: “Americans wake up! Men and women altogether. You have much to do while you live under our greatest enemy, enough of your sleeping! Go on drivebys, and spill all of their blood, or rent a big truck and drive all over them. Veterans, Patriots, Memorial, etc day. Kill them.”For many months in 2015, her Twitter feed was full of incitement, and she says she remained a zealot until the following year. She now says her account was taken over by others.Soon after, she married her second husband, a Tunisian fighter, with whom she had her son, Adam. Her husband was killed in Mosul, and Muthana retreated with dozens of other women deeper into Isis’s ever-shrinking land, where she briefly married a Syrian fighter last year.Muthana says her family in Alabama were deeply conservative and placed restrictions on her movements and interactions, factors she claims contributed to her radicalisation. “You want to go out with your friends and I didn’t get any of that. I turned to my religion and went in too hard. I was self-taught and thought whatever I read, it was right.“I look back now and I think I was very arrogant. Now I’m worried about my son’s future. In the end I didn’t have many friends left, because the more I talked about the oppression of Isis the more I lost friends. I was brainwashed once and my friends are still brainwashed.”Six weeks ago, Muthana fled the village of Susa, not far from the current frontline in Baghuz. She said she slept in the desert for two nights with a group of Isis exiles. She was eventually captured by Kurdish forces who transferred her to al-Hawl, where she now mingles with wives and widows of fighters from around the world.The women cannot leave the camp and are escorted to meetings by armed guards. They have access to food and some aid.Donald Trump on Sunday urged western countries to repatriate captured fighters, appearing to ignore the fact that his administration has shown little enthusiasm for doing so.“The United States is asking Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to take back over 800 Isis fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial,” the US president said. “The caliphate is ready to fall. The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them ...”Muthana said she had not been in contact with US officials since her capture. “I would tell them please forgive me for being so ignorant, and I was really young and ignorant and I was 19 when I decided to leave. I believe that America gives second chances. I want to return and I’ll never come back to the Middle East. America can take my passport and I wouldn’t mind.” – Guardian Subscribe.    </doc>

File photograph: Eric Luke/The Irish Times Minister for Foreign Affairs  will host a private meeting of a group of Arab and EU foreign ministers on Monday to discuss the Middle East peace process.The consultative meeting takes place against the background of the imminent announcement of a new US peace initiative, and, sources say, is an attempt by the more sympathetic EU states to engage with the Palestinans ahead of time. US president Donald Trump’s son-in-law , who has special responsibility for the issue, is expected to unveil US proposals after the Israeli elections in early April. Israel’s Channel 15 TV quotes an Irish diplomatic source saying that the participants want the Palestinians “to feel that they are not alone and have the support of both Arab and European countries”. Mr Coveney is hosting a dinner on Monday and a meeting on Tuesday – described by the Department of Foreign Affairs as a “retreat-style meeting” – in Farmleigh. It will be a “confidential discussion on the present state of the Middle East peace process and how best to move forward”. The confirmed attendance includes representatives from , , , , , , the secretary general of the League of Arab States, and the Palestinian authority.“Ireland’s experience in the past has been that confidentiality can allow for a better discussion between different participants,” a department statement says. “The intention is not to launch any new process but to consider ways to support and shape engagement on this issue in other fora.” Egypt’s  is understood to have flown to Dublin on Sunday evening – his visit will be the first by an Egyptian foreign minister to  in 12 years. He will also meet President  and the Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl. Mr Shoukry expected to make a speech to the Institute of International and European Affairs. Middle East media reports suggest that “ is aware of the upcoming conference and staunchly opposed to it”. A spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry, alluding to the Dáil’s recent attempt to ban products from the Occupied Territories, asked “how Ireland can be an arbiter when it acts against Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East?” Mr Coveney, however, is understood to been in touch with Washington and have allayed US concerns about the meeting. Diplomatic sources stressed that Ireland remains committed to a “two-state solution”, about which the US has been deeply equivocal recently, and would also hope to see discussions about Palestinian “red lines”, settlements and reconciliation within its community. Egyptian participation is seen as particularly important in this context. The Palestinian ambassador to Ireland  is quoted in  saying that planning for the meeting has been going on for five months and noting that “the obstacles Israel used to try [to] halt the meeting have been removed”. Subscribe.

Photograph: Michael Klimentyev/Sputnik moved to shore up flagging domestic support on Wednesday, calling for an increase in government spending to fund national modernisation and help millions of Russians escape the poverty trap.In his televised annual state-of-the-nation speech, the Russian president pledged to deliver an improvement in living standards within the year, saying the government had accumulated huge financial resources to fund development of a prospering, socially inclusive nation.“We are building a model of social and economic development that will allow and guarantee the best conditions for people’s self-realisation, and provide a worthy response to the problems of the fast changing world,” he said.  could only achieve its goals by “joining forces, consolidating society and preparing . . . all citizens of Russia to achieve success”, he said.Mr Putin has seen a sharp drop in his approval ratings since winning a fourth presidential term with a record-breaking majority last March. Government plans to hike the retirement age and raise taxes announced after his re-election sparked nationwide protests, with many Russians complaining that Mr Putin had forgotten about the cares of ordinary people. Pension reforms have stoked public resentment about falling real incomes and the yawning gap between rich and poor. Even official statistics acknowledge that some 19.3 million people are now living below the poverty line – more than 13 per cent of the population. “This is too much,” Mr Putin told 1,500 members of the Russian elite who gathered in a cavernous exhibition hall near the Kremlin to hear the president’s address. “Serious problems beset many people, they have to economise on clothes, medicine and even on food.” Mr Putin devoted most of his speech to fleshing out details of a dozen “national priority projects” unveiled last May that will see investment of some 25.7 trillion rubles (€345 billion) in the modernisation of healthcare, education, housing, infrastructure and agriculture by 2024. Years of tight monetary policies had paid off, allowing Russia to reduce foreign debt and accumulate a large cushion of financial resources, some of which could now be released to fund national development, he said. Measures to halt a population decline – caused by a drop in the birth rate as Russia lurched chaotically from communism to capitalism in the 1990s – would top the agenda in welfare programmes aimed at combatting poverty. Mr Putin promised more generous child benefits and tax and mortgage relief for parents raising more than two children.Increased government spending on health and education would focus on remote regions in the Russian countryside that have seen little benefit from the oil-driven economic boom in the first decade of the noughties that brought prosperity to many large cities. About 200,000 children were studying in village schools without heating, water supply or drains, Mr Putin acknowledged. “If parents see that their children are studying in such conditions all talk about justice and equal opportunities for these people only irritates them.” Massive infrastructure projects would also address imbalances in regional development and boost development of Russia’s backward far east, Mr Putin said. Some 60 airports would be renovated over the coming six years and capacity doubled on the Trans Siberian Railway. Addressing pressing ecological problems, Mr Putin offered some relief for Russians protesting about the hazardous build-up of rubbish at dumps in the periphery of major cities that have been causing health problems for local residents. At least 30 problem dumps would be closed down and a system of waste management and recycling introduced, he said. It was “absolutely inadmissible” for the authorities to “wave aside citizens’ demands” and give the impression that nothing was happening”. Turning to foreign affairs towards the end of his speech, Mr Putin said he hoped that the EU would move to restore political and economic relations with Russia and allow business between the two countries to flourish. He castigated the US for pulling out of a Soviet-era arms reduction treaty on “dreamed-up” charges that Russia had violated terms of the agreement. Russia was pressing ahead with development of a new generation of nuclear weapons to protect national security and, while ready to resume disarmament talks with the US, “would no longer knock on closed doors” in Washington, he said.  Subscribe.    </doc>

Photograph: Ivor Prickett/The New York Times has told the EU it must take back its 800 Islamic State fighters captured in  by US-backed forces and put them on trial. The US president’s call came as he prepared to claim the end of the caliphate in northwest Syria with the fall of the final town held by the militant group.Some EU countries, notably , have said they are preparing to take back their former jihadists, but the UK has been more resistant: it says the fighters held by the west’s Syrian Kurd allies can only return if they seek consular help in . The UK government says it faces a dilemma, especially concerning the wives or children of British fighters, and a major challenge either to prosecute the fighters or prevent them from undertaking terrorist acts in their homeland.Mr Trump tweeted: “The  is asking Britain, France,  and other European allies to take back over 800 Isis fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial. The Caliphate is ready to fall. The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them.“The US does not want to watch as these Isis fighters permeate , which is where they are expected to go. We do so much, and spend so much – Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing. We are pulling back after 100% Caliphate victory!”Diplomats gathered at this weekend’s Munich security conference repeatedly warned that the capture of Isis-held territory does not mean an end to the Isis ideological and terrorist threat; they point to the way in which Isis forces are already regathering in , notably . The  (SDF) say they have cornered the remaining Isis militants in a neighbourhood of Baghuz village near the Iraqi border. Foreign fighters and families have featured prominently among those who have fled the village, which had been been a collection point for extremists who had fled other towns and villages across Syria and Iraq. It is thought to be the last redoubt of zealots who had fought in numerous clashes across both countries.Mr Trump’s remarks mask an intense transatlantic debate under way between politicians and military over how to handle his unilateral decision to withdraw its 2,000 troops in northwest Syria. The US military, and Arab states, have been pressing the Trump administration to delay the move to give more time for an agreement to be reached on how the mainly Kurd SDF are to be protected from a potential Turkish incursion once US forces leave.The Turkish defence minister, , met his US counterpart, , on the sidelines of the Munich conference to press his plan for Turkey to establish a safe zone, saying the Kurds in the SDF are indistinguishable from the Kurdish PKK fighting a separatist terrorist war inside Turkey. The Kurdish leadership is resisting the move, fearing it will lead to either a massacre or displacement of the Kurds.Akar said: “PKK terrorists do not represent our Kurdish brothers. There is no difference between the PKK and the YPG,” Akar told senior US officials during his meetings. He said clearing the Turkey-Syria border area from the PKK and its Syrian branch YPG has been a top priority for , in order to ensure the security of Turkish people. “A 440km-long (273-mile) safe zone in east of Euphrates should be cleared of the terrorist YPG group and should be patrolled by the Turkish forces,” he stressed. But senior Republican senators such as Lindsey Graham have acknowledged that the SDF has borne the brunt of fighting Isis, and there would be long-term implications for the US reputation in the Middle East if it was seen to desert its allies at this stage. – Guardian Subscribe.    </doc>

Coalition warplanes could be seen overhead and the sounds of intermittent gunbattles could be heard from the area, which is completely surrounded by the . “The terrorists are entrenched inside, still betting on ending it militarily,” said , head of the SDF media office. “Our forces said from the start that they have two options: unconditional surrender or for the battle to continue until its end.”The US-led coalition said “the most hardened  fighters remain in Baghouz”, he said, using an alternative name for Islamic State.The village at the Iraqi border is the last scrap of ground left to Islamic State in the Euphrates valley region that became its final major stronghold in  and Syria after a series of catastrophic defeats in 2017.Taking it will nudge the eight-year-old Syrian war towards a new phase, with US president  having pledged to withdraw American troops, leaving a security vacuum that other powers may seek to fill.The SDF could not be certain if some Islamic State fighters had left Baghouz with the civilians, Mr Bali said, adding that security forces were checking the identities of everyone leaving.The SDF was working to evacuate some remaining civilians in Baghouz, he said. “We can’t storm Baghouz before confirming all civilians have been evacuated.”SDF fighters, with troops of the US-led coalition against Islamic State, waited at a position on Baghouz’s outskirts to question the evacuees and record their names, a Reuters witness said.Its defeat marks a big moment in the group’s trajectory, from winning control over vast territories in 2014 and proclaiming the creation of a caliphate to rule over Muslims, to its stubborn demise under concerted military assault.Few believe the capture of Baghouz will end Islamic State’s threat: some fighters still hold out in the central Syrian desert and it has managed to stage repeated guerrilla attacks in areas where its territorial rule was ended.However, it will heighten attention on the promised withdrawal of some 2,000 US troops who have deployed into Syria during the fight against Islamic State, and with it the fate of the Kurdish-led region that the US presence has helped to secure.Mr Trump tweeted on Saturday: “We are pulling back after 100% Caliphate victory.” has repeatedly threatened an incursion because it sees the Kurdish YPG militia, which spearheads the SDF, as a terrorist group inseparable from the PKK which has waged a three-decade insurgency inside its own borders.Facing this prospect, the YPG in December invited the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad to take over the westernmost part of its territory, around the city of , and seeks broader negotiations with him over the area it holds.The SDF on Monday called for 1,000-1,500 international forces to remain in Syria to ensure that Islamic State’s territorial defeat is lasting. The head of US army Central Command, General , said he was still carrying out Mr Trump’s withdrawal order.Among the many civilians who have left Baghouz in recent days are families of Islamic State fighters, including some foreigners who went to Iraq and Syria to join its caliphate.The SDF has complained that Western countries are reluctant to take back such people, who are seen at home as a security threat but might be hard to legally prosecute.Both the SDF and US officials have said the presence of civilians in Islamic State’s last pocket at Baghouz, targeted by air strikes again on Tuesday night, has slowed their advance.During years of steady retreats, Islamic State has honed its tactics of street fighting – sheltering among civilians, digging tunnels and laying innumerable mines and booby traps. – Reuters Subscribe.    </doc>

But I believe in their heads and in their hearts that they know it is over. Brexit now defines and shapes the Conservative party. I’m not leaving the Conservative party, it has left us. The modernising reforms that had taken years to achieve were destroyed,” she said.  The Independent Group was formed on Monday by seven former Labour MPs who were joined on Tuesday by an eighth, . In a joint letter to the prime minister, the three departing Conservative MPs accused her of making no effort to build a cross-party consensus on Brexit.“Instead of seeking to heal the divisions or to tackle the underlying causes of Brexit, the priority was to draw up “red lines”. The 48 per cent were not only sidelined, they were alienated,” they said.  “We find it unconscionable that a party once trusted on the economy, more than any other, is now recklessly marching the country to the cliff edge of no deal. No responsible government should knowingly and deliberately inflict the dire consequences of such a destructive exit on individuals, communities and businesses and put at risk the prospect of ending austerity.”  Mrs May said she was saddened by the MPs’ decision to leave the Conservatives and thanked them for their service to the party. She said she was determined that the Conservatives should offer a “decent, moderate and patriotic” politics but acknowledged that the 2016 referendum had divided the party.   “Of course, the UK’s membership of the EU has been a source of disagreement both in our party and our country for a long time. Ending that membership after four decades was never going to be easy. But by delivering on our manifesto commitment and implementing the decision of the British people we are doing the right thing for our country. And in doing so, we can move forward together towards a brighter future,” she said.  A number of anti-Brexit Conservatives on Wednesday dismissed reports that they were poised to leave the party. But a Labour source said the Conservative defections showed that the Independent Group was a “Tory-establishment” coalition.  “What unites the 11 MPs is their business-as-usual support for austerity, corporate tax cuts and big-money corrupting politics,” the source said. Subscribe.    </doc>

She is a British citizen by birth and has never applied for dual nationality with Bangladesh. It may also be mentioned that she never visited Bangladesh in the past despite her parental lineage.“So, there is no question of her being allowed to enter into Bangladesh.” The statement added that Bangladesh had been made aware of the situation only by the media. Ms Begum’s family’s lawyer, , had earlier said she was born in the UK, had never had a Bangladeshi passport and was not a dual citizen.Ms Begum was one of three schoolgirls to leave  to join the terror group, also known as Isis, in 2015 and resurfaced heavily pregnant at a Syrian refugee camp last week.On Wednesday, she was shown a copy of the Home Office letter that announced her British citizenship would be stripped. She told ITV News: “I don’t know what to say. I am not that shocked but I am a bit shocked.“It’s a bit upsetting and frustrating. I feel like it’s a bit unjust on me and my son.” She went on to say she may try for citizenship in the , where her husband – an Islamic State fighter – is from.Mr Javid defended of the British government’s willingness to use the citizenship powers to prevent the return of “dangerous individuals”. He told the House of Commons that the was never taken lightly, adding: “But when someone turns their back on the fundamental values and supports terror, they don’t have an automatic right to return to the UK.“We must put the safety and security of our country first and I will not hesitate to act to protect it.”While refusing to discuss individual cases, he said each was “carefully considered on its own merits, regardless of gender, age or family status”.Ms Begum’s comments sparked intense debate about the UK’s responsibilities to those seeking to return from Syria. The case took a dramatic turn on Tuesday when it emerged Mr Javid had opted to strip Ms Begum of her British citizenship.The British Nationality Act 1981 provides the home secretary with the power to take such action if it is “conducive to the public good”. A protracted legal battle over the move is now looming with international law forbidding nations from making people stateless., former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said Ms Begum could challenge the decision, and described it as a “complex issue” that could take a while to resolve. “It could run for a very long time through the courts,” he told the BBC.“I suspect that the result is going to be that she will stay where she is for maybe two years at least.”Figures for 2017 show that 104 people were deprived of their British citizenship, up from 14 in the previous year. – PA Subscribe.    </doc>

The force received a report from the ambulance service of a shooting incident in the Ardmonagh Parade area at about 8.05pm. The victim suffered wounds to both of his lower legs and was taken to hospital for treatment. “This was a vicious and brutal attack at a time in the evening when families were going about their business,” PSNI Det Sgt Armstrong said. “The very fact that whoever pulled the trigger thought it was acceptable to recklessly shoot this man in a built-up area where children and teenagers could be passing by shows the contempt they have for their community. The bullets could have strayed at any moment and hit someone passing by. This is utterly appalling and needs to stop.” Anyone who was in the Ardmonagh Parade or Norglen Parade areas last night or who has information about the incident is asked to “call detectives at Musgrave on 101 and quote reference number 1162 of 23/03/19” or the Crimestoppers charity on 0800 555 111. Subscribe.

Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe , the State regulator for parking and clamping operators, is hiring extra staff to cope with the volume of appeals cases coming before it.But despite complaints raised by several TDs over clamping by private operators, including claims that some parking ticket machines are faulty, the NTA said there is “no evidence” of a widespread problem.There is a “two-stage appeals process” against car clamping: firstly to the car park operators, with second and ultimate appeals to be made to the NTA within 30 days of the original rejection.The NTA said it dealt with 1,783 second-stage appeals last year, a rate of almost five every day.Of these, 728, or 40 per cent, were upheld. Another 991 (56 per cent) were “not allowed”, and 64 (4 per cent) were “withdrawn from the process”.Minister for Transport Shane Ross wrote to the National Transport Authority, which is answerable to him, last year to “strongly ask” it to reconsider a fine imposed on one of his constituents after her car was clamped at a Luas station car park.The woman’s car registration was wrongly recorded when she paid for her parking by text. De-clamping fees cost up to €125.People Before Profit TD  raised the issue in the Dáil after he received a number of similar complaints from constituents who had paid for parking but had made a “clerical error” in recording their registration or parking bay number.“The fact that there is such a high success rate of appeals against clamping and fining decisions does suggest that there is something wrong with the system,” he said.Asked about the high ratio of upheld appeals, the NTA said last year marked the first full year of regulation of clamping activities in the State, and it was “not unexpected that the level of upheld appeals would take some time to normalise whilst the industry adjusted to the standards imposed by the new regulatory regime”.“While the NTA has received a small number of second-stage appeals citing faulty parking machines, there is no evidence of widespread faulty parking machines,” a spokesman told The Irish Times.Several people have complained on social media about being clamped at Luas car parks, claiming parking machines were not correctly recording their registration numbers.Transdev, which operates Luas, refused to disclose the number of appeals and complaints it had received over clamping at its car parks, saying the information is “commercially sensitive”.“Regarding the ticket machines, there is no such issue with them,” a spokeswoman added.“If a customer types in the incorrect vehicle registration number and they realise their error upon the ticket being printed by the ticket machine, they can call our customer care team on the lo-call number and have it rectified.”The NTA also dealt with a separate 47 complaints about clamping last year. Of these 27 were not upheld; 11 were upheld; five were partly upheld and four were withdrawn.The NTA said it does not collect information on how much money private operators collect from clamping around the country.Nor does the State agency, responsible for overseeing the clamping industry, keep a register of clamping operators as “it is not provided for under legislation”, a spokesman said.“The Vehicle Clamping Act 2015 does not require parking controllers to register with the NTA prior to engaging in clamping activities,” he added.As required under the same legislation, the NTA appointed one clamping appeals officer in 2017 to adjudicate over second-stage appeals.It is currently seeking to appoint two more due to the “volume of submissions when combined with the time necessary to determine each individual appeal”. Subscribe.

Photograph: AP Photo/Cliff OwenSpecial counsel  has concluded that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign team and  in the 2016 presidential election, US attorney general William Barr has said in a letter to .The four-page letter sent to senior congressional figures on Sunday afternoon says that Mr Mueller’s report, which was submitted to the department of justice on Friday, found no collusion.“The special counsel did not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or co-ordinated with the Russian government,” the letter states.“The evidence ‘does not establish that the president was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference’,” the letter says, quoting directly from Mr Mueller’s report.The findings come after a 22-month investigation by Mr Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction of justice by president .On the issue of obstruction of justice, Mr Barr’s letter is more ambivalent. Noting that Mr Mueller decided not to make a “traditional prosecutorial judgment” on the issue of obstruction of justice, it adds: “While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”The letter states that the special counsel’s decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions “leaves it to the attorney general to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime”.No Collusion, No Obstruction, Complete and Total EXONERATION. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!The Department of Justice “determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgement.”Mr Barr writes that, together with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, he has concluded that “the evidence developed during the special counsel investigation is not sufficient to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offence”.Following the release of the letter, US president Donald Trump tweeted that he had been completely exonerated by Mr Mueller of collusion or obstruction of justice.“It’s a shame that our country had to go through this,” Mr Trump later told reporters before boarding Air Force One to return to Washington from Florida. “This was an illegal takedown that failed. And hopefully, somebody’s going to be looking at the other side.”However, Jerry Nadler, the head of the judiciary committee in the House of Representatives, noted that the special counsel “clearly and explicitly is not exonerating the president.“We must hear from AG Barr about his decision-making and see all the underlying evidence for the American people to know all the facts.”Mr Nadler said he will be calling Mr Barr to testify “in light of the very concerning discrepancies” in the attorney general’s summary of the report.But Republicans said the letter exonerated the president. Senator Lindsey Graham said it was a “bad day for those hoping the Mueller investigation would take president Trump down . . .

Photograph:  Marty Melville/ AFP/Getty ImagesNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced on Monday a royal commission, a powerful form of public inquiry, into the events leading up to a March 15th attack on two mosques in Christchurch that killed 50 people.“It is important that no stone is left unturned to get to the bottom of how this act of terrorism occurred and what, if any, opportunities we had to stop it,” Ardern told reporters at Parliament House in the capital, Wellington.A suspected white supremacist has been charged with one count of murder over the Christchurch shootings and will next appear in court on April 5th. Ms Ardern has said the man had not been on any watch lists in New Zealand or Australia.She said a major focus of the inquiry would be whether security agencies focused their attention on the right issues and whether there were any clues that were missed.It would also include the role of social media and the suspect’s ability to obtain a weapon, Ms Ardern said.The precise terms of reference for the royal commission have yet to be announced but Ms Ardern’s decision to call such an inquiry was welcomed by members of New Zealand’s Muslim community.“The announcement of an inquiry is a great call and the right thing to do. I hope that it will be an inclusive inquiry and that an opportunity will be provided to the Muslim community to feed into the terms of reference,” said Guled Mire, a Muslim community advocate.“It’s important we get this right so we can learn from past mistakes,” he said.Royal commissions are independent inquiries and are usually reserved for matters of the greatest public importance. Ardern said such an inquiry was an appropriate response to the attack but declined to give a timeframe while her government finalised the terms of reference.Massey University security and defence analyst Rhys Ball, who formerly worked for New Zealand’s intelligence service, said the inquiry should include agencies such as customs, police and immigration.“I know that right-wing extremism was always considered a potential problem and was monitored from time to time and investigated,” Mr Ball said.“There may be some failings, may have been things missed, but it’s only fair that you apply that scrutiny to all agencies involved,” he said.Mr Ball said the United States and Australia had held similar wide-ranging inquiries in the aftermath of major attacks. – Reuters Subscribe.    </doc>

The Isis spokesman cited the fierce battle taking place in Baghouz. Photograph: Giuseppe Cacace/AFP/Getty ImagesThe spokesman of the Islamic State group emerged from nearly six months of silence on Monday to mock America’s assertion of having defeated the group and to call for retaliation over last week’s mosque attacks in . “The scenes of the massacres in the two mosques should wake up those who were fooled, and should incite the supporters of the caliphate to avenge their religion,” the spokesman, Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, said in a 44-minute audio recording. Al-Muhajir portrayed the shootings by a white extremist, which killed 50 Muslims as they prayed in the city of Christchurch, as an extension of the campaign against Islamic State. He likened the mosque attacks to the weeks-long battle raging in the last village under Islamic State control in . “Here is Baghouz in Syria, where Muslims are burned to death and are bombed by all known and unknown weapons of mass destruction,” he said, painting the people in the town as regular Muslims when in fact coalition officials believe that the majority of them are either Islamic State fighters or their wives and children.Throughout his speech, al-Muhajir belittled the White House’s claim of victory over the terrorist organisation, calling it a “state of confusion and contradiction that make it impossible for any observer to know what is meant by the word ‘victory.’”While Islamic State has lost all but a sliver of the vast territory it once controlled in  and Syria, military officials say the group remains a potent threat. Al-Muhajir – the name is an invention, and his true identity is unknown – is a faceless but important figure inside the terrorist group. He is not known to have ever appeared in photographs or in the group’s numerous videos, and almost nothing is known about his personal biography.In a testament to the security precautions he takes, he released just two audio statements in 2018, with the last one, appearing in September, less than four minutes long. The spokesman’s extended absences – much like those of the group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi – have fuelled rumours of his death.Beyond its references to recent events, what is notable about the recording – which was released by the group on the Telegram mobile messaging app – are its numerous mentions of in-the-weeds details regarding Islamic State-related current events.Al-Muhajir refers to President Donald Trump’s claim not to know Brett McGurk, the US special envoy in the fight against Islamic State, who resigned in protest over Mr Trump’s decision to pull US troops from Syria. As anti-Islamic State forces pursue al-Muhajir and other senior members of the militant group, it is assumed that they avoid detection by shunning electronics, especially mobile phones, and limiting contact with couriers, whose movements can be tracked. That raises a number of questions: How did he know about the slaughter of Muslims in New Zealand? Is he hunkered down in a house in Iraq or Syria and relying on local TV coverage? Did one of his aides bring him the news?His detailed knowledge of current events is clear as he makes a jab at Mr Trump’s hasty visit to Iraq in December, his first to see troops stationed in a combat zone. At the time, the president called it “sad” that he had to take such extensive security measures to make the trip even after the  had spent $7 trillion trying to stabilise the Middle East.Al-Muhajir refers to the $7 trillion, adding: “How strange for a victor who can’t even announce publicly an official visit to a country he claims to be bringing peace and stability to. He could only come like a frightened and cowardly thief.”Among the revelations in the recording is that al-Baghdadi, the group’s leader, is still alive, at least according to the spokesman. Although al-Baghdadi has been declared dead several times, most recently by  after an air strike in Syria, US officials have long maintained that he is most likely still living.Al-Muhajir closes the recording by referring to al-Baghdadi using an honorific, “May God preserve him”, that is employed when a person is still alive. In the final passage of his speech, the spokesman offers a tip from al-Baghdadi, suggesting he has spoken to him: “A message of advice from the caliph of the believers regarding communication devices: Be careful, careful of communication devices – even if it slows down work from two days to seven days.” – New York Times Subscribe.    </doc>

Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesThe Kurdish-led  captured hundreds of wounded jihadis on Tuesday at the eastern Syrian village of Baghouz, the last bastion of the former “caliphate” stretching from central  to eastern . Kurdish spokesman  said 157 jihadis, “mostly foreign nationals”, had been seized while wounded fighters were being transported to medical facilities in Hasakeh province in northeastern Syria.Although he told Kurdish news agency Rudaw that the Kurds have taken over the tent camp of Islamic State (also known as Isis), the battle has not yet been won. “This is not a victory announcement, but [a report on] significant progress in the fight against [Isis]. Clashes are continuing as a group of Isis terrorists who are confined to a tiny area still fight back.” Isis fighters have also mounted attacks on Kurdish positions outside Baghouz. Another Kurdish spokesman, Kino Gabriel, has estimated that some 5,000 fighters and family members remain in the besieged, shelled, scorched and bombarded pocket, sheltering in trenches and tunnels.When they mounted their campaign in southeastern Syria, the Kurds did not expect an exodus of 34,000 local and displaced civilians, 5,000 fighters and 35,000 family members from the Baghouz enclave. Among the civilians were hostages, enslaved Yazidis and Iraqi Sunni tribesmen who had taken refuge from Iraqi Shia militiamen in Baghouz, which is located just across the border from Iraq. In a separate operation, Kurdish forces have detained Isis militants involved in the January suicide bombing that killed four US military personnel in the northern Syrian town of . This was the worst attack on US forces since they entered Syria in 2015. In the northwest, the Syrian army, backed by Russian air strikes, has been attacking jihadi groups in  province. This is not the promised frontal assault postponed last September but tactical operations on the edges of the province where thousands of jihadi fighters are based among three million civilians. The army has been compelled to take action by al-Qaeda’s  and its allies, which have staged attacks outside Idlib. Jihadis have brought in  by launching armed drones at the Russian airbase in Latakia province south of Idlib.Following consultations with Iraqi and Iranian army chiefs visiting , Syrian defence minister  said: “The Syrian government will reassert its complete control over all Syrian territory sooner or later.” Damascus “will deal with [Kurdish forces] in one or two ways: a reconciliation agreement or liberating the territory they control by force.” The Kurds responded by criticising the “threatening language” used by Mr Ayoub. Damascus has been negotiating terms with the Kurds, who hold 25 per cent of Syria, since last year but they seek autonomy in a federation – a demand the government rejects. Mr Ayoub also vowed to reclaim Idlib and stressed the importance of co-operation and co-ordination among the three militaries “to confront challenges, dangers and threats” posed by terrorism. On the political front, new UN envoy Geir Pederson of  was told by Syrian foreign minister  that the process of writing and adopting a post-war constitution must be “Syrian led and owned”, thereby dismissing efforts of external actors to draft a document. Subscribe.    </doc>

Photograph: Alex Kraus/Bloomberg The , hereafter referred to as “the Union”, and the  of Great Britain and Northern , hereafter referred to as “the United Kingdom”, have agreed a number of measures to enhance and expedite the process of negotiating and bringing into force their future relationship, supplementing those set out in the Political Declaration endorsed by the Union and the United Kingdom on November 25th, 2018.First, the Union and the United Kingdom wish to emphasise their shared and solemn regard for the vision for the future relationship detailed in the Political Declaration. In this context, and in line with Paragraph 1 of the Political Declaration, both the Union and the United Kingdom reiterate the clear and important link between the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration, which while being of a different nature are part of the same negotiated package. As stated in Article 184 of the Withdrawal Agreement and reflected also in Paragraph 138 of the Political Declaration, the Union and the United Kingdom have committed to use best endeavours, in good faith and in full respect of the respective legal orders, to take necessary steps to negotiate expeditiously the agreements governing their future relationship referred to in the Political Declaration. The Union underlined this relationship between them when it published the two texts side by side in its Official Journal on February 19th, and the Parliament of the United Kingdom must consider and approve both together. Second, the Union and the United Kingdom have the shared ambition to have the future relationship in place by the end of the transition period. To this end, the Union and the United Kingdom have confirmed that immediately following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal, they will take the steps necessary to begin formal negotiations. The Union and the United Kingdom have agreed that negotiations on the various strands of the future relationship will then proceed in parallel. Should national ratifications be pending at the end of the transition period, the  has already made clear that it is ready to propose applying on a provisional basis relevant aspects of the future relationship, in line with the applicable legal frameworks and existing practice and the United Kingdom welcomes this intent. Third, with a view to providing a sound foundation for the talks and building on the commitments already contained in the Political Declaration, the Union and the United Kingdom will expeditiously:  identify those areas which are likely to require the greatest consideration, and the associated technical and legal issues that will need to be addressed, in order that the necessary technical preparations can be made on both sides; and  draw up a full schedule for the negotiations, taking into account various internal processes, including the  elections and the appointment of a new Commission. Fourth, and in the context of open and fair competition, the Union notes the United Kingdom’s intention to ensure that its social and employment standards and its environmental standards do not regress from those in place at the end of the transition period, and to provide its Parliament the opportunity to consider future changes in Union law in these areas. Fifth, given the Union’s and the United Kingdom’s firm commitment to work at speed on a subsequent agreement that establishes by December 31st, 2020 alternative arrangements such that the backstop solution in the Protocol on Ireland/ will not need to be applied, a specific negotiating track will be established at the outset and as part of the negotiations to lead the analysis and development of these alternative arrangements. This dedicated track will consider the use of all existing and emerging facilitative arrangements and technologies, with a view to assessing their potential to replace, in whole or in part, the backstop solution in the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland.That assessment will include an evaluation of their practicability and deliverability in the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland. By virtue of being embedded in the overall negotiation structure, the negotiating track on alternative arrangements will be able to take account of progress made in the wider negotiations on the future relationship, in particular on goods regulations and customs.In addition, and in support of their work on alternative arrangements, both the Union and the United Kingdom will consult with private sector experts, businesses, trade unions, the institutions established under the Good Friday or  Agreement, and appropriate involvement of parliaments. In the first instance, the progress concerning alternative arrangements will be assessed at the first high level conference envisaged by the Political Declaration. To ensure that the negotiations are concluded in good time, further progress will be reviewed at each subsequent high level conference.The United Kingdom reiterates its wish to establish a future partnership that is as close and strong as possible, given the global challenges it shares with the European Union, and underlines its commitment to embark on preparations immediately after the signature of the Withdrawal Agreement to ensure that negotiations on the future relationship can start as soon as possible after withdrawal.In that light, the United Kingdom notes, subject to Article 1(4) of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, that the objective of the Withdrawal Agreement is not to establish a permanent relationship between the Union and the United Kingdom, and that the provisions of the Protocol are therefore intended to apply only temporarily, taking into account the commitments of the Parties set out in Article 2(1). The preamble to the Protocol further recalls that the Withdrawal Agreement, which is based on Article 50 TEU, does not aim at establishing a permanent future relationship between the Union and the United Kingdom.The United Kingdom wishes to record its understanding of the effect of this provision if, contrary to the intentions of the parties, it is not possible for them to conclude an agreement which supersedes the Protocol in whole or in part due to a breach of Article 5 of the Withdrawal Agreement by the Union. The United Kingdom would not consider its application to be temporary in these circumstances, as in its view the Protocol would then constitute a permanent relationship between the Union and the United Kingdom. Article 1(4) makes clear this is not the Parties’ intention. If under these circumstances it proves not to be possible to negotiate a subsequent agreement as envisaged in Article 2 of the Protocol, the United Kingdom records its understanding that nothing in the Withdrawal Agreement would prevent it from instigating measures that could ultimately lead to disapplication of obligations under the Protocol, in accordance with Part Six, Title III of the Withdrawal Agreement or Article 20 of the Protocol, and under the proviso that the UK will uphold its obligations under the 1998 Agreement in all its dimensions and under all circumstances and to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. as part of the European Commission's approach to transparency on Article 50 negotations with the United Kingdom Subscribe.

During late-night talks in Strasbourg,  and  president Jean-Claude Juncker signed off on a joint interpretive instrument on the withdrawal agreement and a joint statement on the political declaration., the prime minister’s de facto deputy, told the House of Commons the interpretive instrument has the same legal status as the withdrawal agreement. He said it provides confirmation the EU cannot try to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely and that doing so would be a breach of the legally-binding commitments both sides have agreed.“If – contrary to all expectations – the EU were to act with that intention, the UK could use this acceptance of what could constitute an explicit breach as the basis for a formal dispute, through independent arbitration, that such a breach had occurred – ultimately suspending the protocol if the EU continued to breach its obligations,” he said.“On top of this, the joint instrument also reflects the United Kingdom’s and European Union’s commitment to work to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by December 2020, setting out explicitly that these arrangements do not need to replicate the provisions of the backstop in any respect.”In a joint press conference with Mrs May in Strasbourg on Monday night, Mr Juncker said the backstop was an insurance policy “no more, no less” and it was never intended to be used. He said the Taoiseach had told him he would support the deal, along with the rest of the . Mrs May said MPs had made clear legal changes were needed. “What we have secured is that the backstop cannot be indefinite,” she said.Mr Juncker said that if MPs vote against the deal today, there would be no further negotiations on the withdrawal agreement or the backstop.A joint statement issued by the EU and the UK promised “a specific negotiating track” would be established as part of the negotiations. “This dedicated track will consider the use of all existing and emerging facilitative arrangements and technologies, with a view to assessing their potential to replace, in whole or in part, the backstop solutiMonon in the Protocol on Ireland/ Northern Ireland. That assessment will include an evaluation of their practicability and deliverability in the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland.” MPs will vote today on the PM’s  deal, which they rejected by 230 votes in January. DUP deputy leader , whose party’s support is regarded at Westminster as key to approving the deal, said he would analyse “very carefully” what emerges from Strasbourg.In Dublin, the Cabinet met for 90 minutes on Monday night while the negotiations were under way and Taoiseach  spoke by phone to Mr Juncker during the meeting. Cabinet sources said that the discussions centred around an agreed legal interpretation of the Withdrawal Agreement and the documents associated with it.Mr Varadkar and his senior staff were due to travel to the US for the annual St Patrick’s Day series of events, but postponed their departure. It had been intended that Mr Varadkar would be in Washington DC today, ahead of the beginning of the official programme beginning tomorrow, to monitor Brexit votes in Westminster. The Taoiseach is due to meet US president  tomorrow. Mrs May flew to Strasbourg on Monday afternoon after negotiations with Brussels appeared to get back on track following a setback on Sunday.

Photograph: Spencer Platt/GettyAs the great and the good of the film world gathered in the mountain town of Park City in  late last month for the Sundance Film Festival there was one person on everybody’s mind. , the movie producer who is facing widespread sexual assault allegations, may not have been in attendance, but his presence was undeniable.Untouchable, a new documentary about the Weinstein scandal directed by , premiered at the festival. In the feature-length documentary, a dozen women document their experience of the movie mogul during his years at the helm of  films.The film’s debut at one of America’s most acclaimed festivals is deeply ironic. Sundance was where Miramax, a film venture of Weinstein and his brother Bob, began to flourish, after they took a punt on Steven Soderbergh’s indie film Sex, Lies, and Videotape, which won the audience award in 1989.As Miramax grew into one of the most successful independent film companies in history, Weinstein became a regular fixture at the annual festival in rural Utah.It is also where actor Rose McGowan, one of the first high-profile women to accuse Weinstein of assault, says she was raped by him 20 years ago, in his hotel suite after a screening of one of his films in which she starred, a charge he denies.Weinstein’s fall from grace at Sundance epitomises the changing fortunes of a man who was once one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood. He has also become a symbol of the #MeToo movement, a cause that has shone a light on the culture of sexual harassment and its implications for the power dynamics of the workplace.A married father of five, Harvey Weinstein’s alleged behaviour first came to light in a New York Times article in October 2017. The article detailed allegations of sexual assault made by prominent female actors, and found evidence of allegations “stretching over nearly three decades” based on interviews with Miramax employees, emails and internal documents.The article claimed that Weinstein had reached at least eight settlements with women.The accused gave a statement to the paper in which he “sincerely apologised” for his behaviour in the past, and said he was working with therapists.A follow-up article in the New Yorker within a week contained allegations from 13 more women. As the allegations built up, the board of Miramax moved to remove Weinstein, while his wife, the British designer , announced she was leaving her husband of 10 years.More and more women began to come forward with stories, including prominent actors such as  and . One by one, organisations such as Bafta and The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences moved to expel Weinstein. The Producers Guild of America banned Weinstein for life.One of Weinstein’s most vocal accusers has been . The 50-year-old actor was one of the first to speak out against Weinstein. She first made allegations that she had been abused by a studio mogul in an interview with Variety magazine in 2015.Two years later she said the man in question was Weinstein. She alleges she was sexually harassed by him during the filming of the 1997 film Kiss the Girls after he invited her to a business meeting at a Beverley Hills hotel.In April last year Judd filed a sexual harassment and defamation lawsuit against Weinstein.In her lawsuit she cites comments by film director  in late 2017, when he said that he had not cast Judd in his Lord of the Rings trilogy because of comments Weinstein had made about her lack of professionalism.“As my experience and the experience of others shows, even a few false statements from Mr Weinstein could destroy potentially career-changing professional opportunities,” the lawsuit states. “It’s time that Mr Weinstein be held accountable for that conduct and for the ways in which he’s damaged careers.”Weinstein’s lawyers hit back against the claim, stating at the time of the lawsuit: “The most basic investigation of the facts will reveal that Mr Weinstein neither defamed Ms Judd nor ever interfered with Ms Judd’s career, and instead not only championed her work but also repeatedly approved her casting for two of his movies over the next decade.”In a setback for Judd, a court in  last month dismissed her harassment case against Weinstein, claiming that a law related to professional misconduct could not be applied retrospectively to Judd’s case.The judge ruled that she could still pursue the defamation claim, however.In total, more than 80 women have come forward accusing Weinstein of offences from rape to sexual harassment. His prosecution, however, is centred around a criminal case taken against him in New York.The movie producer is facing five felony charges there relating to two women, after a sixth charge relating to a third woman was dismissed in October last year.The dismissal followed information that a witness had been advised by a police officer to suppress her doubts over whether an alleged sexual encounter with Weinstein was not consensual. The same policeman was also accused of urging one of Weinstein’s accusers to delete material from her phones before handing them over to prosecutors.Nevertheless, the charges relating to two women still stand.Weinstein is accused of raping a woman in a New York hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on another woman at his  apartment in 2006. Separately, cases are under way in Britain over alleged incidents dating back from the late 1980s.Weinstein continues to vigorously defend his innocence, claiming that any sexual encounters were consensual. But the mogul is having legal difficulties of his own.In a surprise development, last month , the prominent defence lawyer representing Weinstein, parted ways with his client.Brafman previously – and successfully – represented Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former IMF chief who saw charges of sexual assault against him dropped in 2011.Weinstein’s new legal team includes prominent female lawyer , who defended basketball player Kobe Bryant on rape charges in 2003., another senior lawyer on the case, successfully defended Casey Anthony, who was on trial for murdering her two-year-old daughter in Florida. He went on to defend football player , who was acquitted on a double-murder charge, though he took his own life days later.In his first comments after his appointment to Weinstein’s legal team, Baez said that his client was innocent. “This case is testing the presumption of innocence in our country . . . he should be entitled to the same presumption as everyone else.”With Weinstein continuing to deny the felony charges against him, he is due back in court for a pre-trial hearing on March 7th. The Manhattan trial is due to begin in May.He could face life in prison if convicted. Since his indictment Weinstein has been ordered to remain in New York and  on a $1 million bail and to wear an ankle tracking device.Whatever the outcome of the trial, it is a stunning fall from grace for one of Hollywood’s biggest names, and a telling reminder of the power of the #MeToo movement to hold those accused of sexual misconduct to account. Subscribe.    </doc>

Photograph: iStock A clique of French journalists has been accused of bullying female colleagues via social media.Six people have been suspended for their role in the closed  group Ligue du LOL, a macho online “boys’ club” that reportedly harassed female and minority ethnic journalists for years.The group, believed to have had about 30 members, is said to have spread pornographic memes online and doctored photos to humiliate its victims.What group members claim started as dubious humour in private exchanges, however, appears to have soon degenerated and spread on to the wider web mostly through Twitter.It seems some of the victims were aware of the identity of a number of their alleged harassers - those members of the Ligue who posted on social networks under their real names - but were afraid to speak out. The league’s founder, Vincent Glad, was suspended by  newspaper on Monday after the paper verified the existence of the group during a fact-checking exercise.Among others being disciplined are one of  senior online editors, Alexandre Hervaud, and David Doucet, the web editor-in-chief of , a high-profile music and culture magazine. Doucet wrote on Twitter: “I was a member of the Ligue du LOL for two years. I left the group six years ago, in the small world that was then Twitter, I saw that certain people were regularly targeted but I never guessed the depth of the trauma suffered. I was cowardly and too happy to be one of this band that the Twittersphere then admired, to intervene. I would like to say that I never did any of the photomontages, took part in raids or participated in the evenings described. This speaking out has above all made me realise that I was one of the tormentors.”The videomaker Florence Porcel said she had been the victim of an “online lynching” and had been humiliated when a member of the Ligue du LOL called her pretending to offer her a job, while recording the conversation.“When the recording was made public, I cried from shame, humiliation and fear for three days. I didn’t want to go out,” she said. Porcel said she had also featured in a “very degrading pornographic photomontage, that was their method”. Doucet admitted in a tweet that he had posed as a recruiter from a television station and called Porcel. “I am sorry,” he wrote.The journalist Melanie Wanga said she believed the league’s members were finally getting what they deserved. “Imagine being a young, black woman journalist talking about blackface and apartheid and getting this stuff multiplied by 20 from your ‘colleagues’,” she said, sharing tweets she suspected had come from unidentified members of the league.Capucine Piot, a former journalist now in marketing, said she had been the victim of several “mocking” photomontages and videos criticising her appearance. “It was very hard for a developing young woman. After reading so much dirt about myself I was convinced I was worthless,” she tweeted.Other victims have remained anonymous. “Those guys, they thought they were making jokes but they were ruining our lives,” said one.Hervaud wrote a long message on Twitter apologising for “condescending” tweets he had posted on Friday when the scandal first broke, and said he offered “sincere if belated apologies to those he had hurt”. He said the Ligue “never aimed to co-ordinate hateful campaigns targeting anyone. But it doesn’t serve to minimise or deny the evidence. The permanent spirit of mockery and cynicism of the group obviously influenced the actions of certain more borderline members, notably those covered by anonymity, who, by the snowball effect inspired other internet users outside the group.” He admitted some of the victim statements had “literally twisted my stomach”.Christophe Carron, the editor of the French edition of the online magazine , also admitted having been a member of the group but denied “socially or professionally damaging anyone, or harassing anyone”. The  director, Laurent Joffrin, announced an internal investigation. “We have nothing to hide,” he said.In an apology published on Twitter, Glad said he had “created a monster that escaped”.“The object of the group was not to harass women, just to amuse ourselves. But quickly, our way of amusing ourselves became very problematic and we didn’t realise this. We thought that everyone visible on the internet, by a blog, or Twitter account or something else, deserved to be mocked,” Glad wrote. He added that he didn’t realise that this could “become a hell for the people targeted”. Other Ligue members who have been suspended from their roles include Guilhem Malissen, a humourist on food podcast , who apologised on Twitter; Renaud Loubert-Aledo, who worked at Publicis Consultants; and Guillaume Ledit, a journalist with , a quarterly magazine “exploring the future”. Another member, Stephen des Aulnois, the founder of online pornographic magazine , said he was suspending the website and stepping down voluntarily.The blogger and author Matthias Jambon-Puillet recounted, under his pseudonym Benjamin LeReilly, receiving anonymous insults and that a photomontage of him performing a sex act was sent - purportedly from him - to minors. Although he does not know who sent the insults, he said he believed they came from members of the league. France’s minister for digital affairs, Mounir Mahjoubi, described the men behind the Facebook group as “losers”.“It is a group of guys high on their power at being able to make fun of other people. Except that their mockery had an effect in real life,” he said.–Guardian  Subscribe.    </doc>

Video: LBCSammy Wilson: DUP want to give due diligence to what has been said. Photo: Liam McBurney DUP’s  spokesman  has said Theresa May’s assurances on the Irish backstop fall short of what she herself has promised.Speaking to radio station LBC, Mr Wilson said, however, that the party want to give due diligence to what has been said.“I’ve got to say if you look at what the prime minister has said so far, it seems to fall short of what she herself has promised. Because she is simply it reduces the chances of us being kept in the backstop.“We promised last night that whatever came out of , we would look at very closely. We would also take advice on it and come to our own conclusions.“But we have made it quite clear that we would expect there to be legally-binding changes which would ensure that our government solely had control of any backstop, that those legally-binding changes would ensure that in the future arrangements with , we would have control over our trade, our laws, our money and that those legally-binding changes would ensure the integrity of the union.“That’s how we will judge the changes which have been made and what has been agreed.”Mr Wilson says his party is not averse to the postponement of Tuesday’s vote in the House of Commons about the withdrawal agreement.“If the government wants full scrutiny and not to be accused of rail roading this through, then there is the option to put the vote off, we wouldn’t be averse to that,” he told BBC Radio Ulster.The DUP will listen to the Attorney General’s advice, talk to colleagues across Northern Ireland, members of the Conservative Party and will also seek independent legal advice, he said.“We will give it a fair hearing. All those things will go into the mix before making a decision.“We have set out our criteria to back any deal, if they are not met then we will vote against it.”Mr Wilson said that the decision was not be the DUP’s responsibility alone. “At the end of the day it will be a collective decision.“We have to gain control over our laws and trade, if the agreement doesn’t give us that then we won’t support any agreement.”He added that it was reasonable for some to point out that today’s vote should be deferred “because there is so much to be examined.”The Chief Whip of the DUP, Jeffrey Donaldson, says that his party has not come to a decision yet on new EU backstop measures.“We will have to take time to study it and look at the legal consequences,” he told RTÉ Radio’s Morning Ireland.“We await the Attorney General’s response, we certainly need greater clarity.“We will take our own counsel. His (Attorney General) interpretation is important, his role is to give the legal view. But in the end we will take our own counsel and come to a decision.”Mr Donaldson said he wants to see if the Attorney General’s legal advice has changed from the position he took previously in relation to the backstop.When asked if the vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons Tuesday should be deferred, Mr Donaldson said “we could do with more time to come to a definitive agreement.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Video: European CommissionBritish prime minister Theresa May and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker are pictured during a  news conference in Strasbourg on Monday. Photograph: Vincent Kessler/Reuters.British prime minister  says she has secured “legally binding changes” to the  withdrawal agreement and the  backstop ahead of a crucial House of Commons vote on Tuesday.Speaking at a press conference with  president  in Strasbourg on Monday night, Mrs May said she had agreed “exactly” what parliament had asked her to, including a a means to exit the controversial backstop, which has angered many MPs.Mr Juncker said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had informed him that he “would be prepared to accept this solution in the interest of securing an overall deal” but he warned there would not be a third round of negotiations on the withdrawal agreement.He appealed to MPs to support the deal, warning that there could be “no further chances” and that it is “this deal or Brexit might not happen at all”.The agreement involves a legal strengthening of the assurances given in January by the EU through a “joint legal instrument” on the impermanence of the backstop. Mrs May insisted this would have “the same status” as the withdrawal agreement.The text will also strengthen the ability of the UK to ask independent arbitrators in the event of deadlock caused by EU bad faith in negotiations to allow for the partial or total dismantlement of the backstop. Amendments to the political declaration on the future relationship will recommit both sides to immediate talks on a deal which will include “alternative arrangements” which can replace the backstop.Mrs May said she still believes the withdrawal agreement “delivers on the decision taken by the British people” to leave the EU but that it was not previously made clear enough that the backstop is a temporary measures.Now, she said, there is a “joint instrument with comparable legal weight to the withdrawal agreement will guarantee that the EU cannot act with the intent of applying the backstop indefinitely”.Our agreement provides meaningful clarifications &amp; legal guarantees to the Withdrawal Agreement &amp; . The choice is clear: it is this deal, or  may not happen at all. Let’s bring the UK’s withdrawal to an orderly end. We owe it to history.  “If they do, it can be challenged through arbitration and if they are found to be in breach the UK can suspend the backstop. The joint instrument also gives a legal commitment that whatever replaces the backstop does not need to replicate it,” the prime minister said.The latest version of the agreement will now be examined by the UK attorney general Geoffrey Cox, whose advice will be shared with MPs before Tuesday’s vote.In relation to the backstop, Mr Juncker said that “if either side were to act in bad faith, there is a legal way for the other party to exit”.“The instrument which sets out these details has legal force while fully respecting the guidelines of the European Council...It compliments the withdrawal agreement without reopening it.”An extra Cabinet meeting took place in Dublin on Monday evening in light of the developments on the continent and Ministers were due to resume their discussions after the agreement was announced.Ministers insisted there has been no change in the position that the UK cannot unilaterally exit the backstop.Mr Varadkar adjourned the Cabinet meeting to take a phone call from Mr Juncker before Ministers resumed their discussions. The Cabinet meeting was then adjourned a second time pending the outcome of the talks in Strasbourg.With less than three weeks to Brexit day on March 29th — when Britain is due to leave the EU — any delay would raise renewed questions as to whether there was any way Mrs May could get her deal through the Commons. It was resoundingly rejected by a 230-vote majority by MPs in January.The prime minister has said that if she loses the vote on Tuesday, there will be further votes on Wednesday on whether the UK should leave with no-deal and on Thursday on whether they should seek an extension to the article 50 withdrawal process.Many at Westminster believe that in that event MPs would vote to delay Britain’s departure — to the fury of Brexiteers.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that MPs must reject the latest proposal from Mrs May when it is put to a vote on Tuesday.“The prime minister’s negotiations have failed. This evening’s agreement with the European Commission does not contain anything approaching the changes Theresa May promised parliament,” he said in a statement. “That’s why Members of Parliament must reject this deal tomorrow.”Mr Juncker wrote to European Council late on Monday to say that the UK must leave the EU by the time of the European Parliament elections in late May.“The United Kingdom’s withdrawal should be complete before the European elections that will take place between May 23rd-26th this year,” he said.“If the  has not left the  by then, it will be legally required to hold these elections.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA Wire“Living on the border, we’ve all engaged in a wee bit of smuggling,” recalls , Fianna Fáil TD for Louth. “It was seen in the past as an acceptable way for a guy to supplement his income. But we’ve moved way beyond that. It’s not what someone takes in their car, it’s what’s coming in lorries.”Given the Border’s intricate networks of back roads, unofficial crossings, currency and tariff mismatches, a little bit of smuggling was unavoidable during the bad days.However, organised criminals have made millions from smuggling cigarettes, fuel and alcohol across the Border even after the Belfast Agreement in 1998.The UK government’s tariffs proposal, announced on Wednesday, is dramatic. It would see no import tariffs on goods coming from Ireland to Northern Ireland, while London would impose no new checks or controls on such goods.The announcement was couched in the language of peace and commerce, referring to Northern Ireland’s “unique social, political and economic circumstances”.The proposal is a perfect storm for smuggling, however. Leave an open border dividing differing customs rules and there’s a high risk of smuggling, says Carol Lynch, a partner in  Dublin’s customs department. Others are more forthright: “[It’s] almost legitimising smuggling, it’s inviting it. It’s that bizarre – it’s accepting smuggling is going to happen,” says Paul MacFlynn, a Belfast-based economist with the . Those who policed border trade – both legal and illegal – are aghast, including Cork-born Tim Mullan who runs a guesthouse in Dundalk. He served for 30 years as a customs officer.“Smuggling? I can see guys who used to be involved years ago rubbing their hands at the moment,” he says. “Very often, the smuggler is ahead of the officialdom, they can find loopholes quicker than we know they’re there.”Export subsidies on animals or grain in the past were ruthlessly exploited, where animals and goods were smuggled again and again: “The animals used to be dizzy going around,” he says.The UK ’s plan not to police its own borders “in effect, it turns the UK into a fiscal rogue state”, one former Revenue official says. “If it’s not going to keep its bargain within international rules, then that creates problems for all of your neighbours. I think it’s a disaster,” he says.Retail Ireland director Thomas Burke says shops have been “acutely aware” for years about smuggling, while the British move “may unintentionally create conditions that encourages such behaviour”.“Any divergence in practice or standards on either side of the Border would inevitably further incentivise such behaviour and would immediately disadvantage compliant businesses,” he says. The potential blow to co-operation between Revenue, HM Revenue and Customs, the Garda and the PSNI could also smooth things for smugglers, he says. He recalls stories of HMRC inspectors who would visit counterparts in Donegal, quietly exchanging briefcases of documents. “There is currently a very high level of cooperation between Gardaí, PSNI and Revenue, if the UK is not going to police its side of the border, then cooperation ends. Then smuggling becomes rife.”A Revenue official shares these concerns: “It’s like policing and criminal law and mutual assistance requests; there will still be cooperation, but to what level will it be affected?”Fianna Fáil TD Declan Breathnach emphasises that smugglers today are not sole operations, but organised gangs: “We’re not talking about the guy doing a run down in his car to do a bit of fuel. We’re talking about people who employ chemists for diesel laundering.”And it will go beyond just the smuggling of goods: “There was clearly evidence in the past that some of the large smugglers facilitated people smuggling, such as Afghanis, into the state,” said another ex-Customs officials.For veteran  watchers, the newly proposed no-deal border rules are another indication of the disorganisation at the heart of UK politics. “It’s basically admitting they don’t have a solution,” says Katy Hayward of Queen’s University Belfast. But for those who have spent a lifetime on the Border, it’s more than that. “The natives,” says Mr Breathnach, “are growing restless.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

His breach of his plea deal means he is likely to face a much tougher prison sentence than previously thought probable. File photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters has been confirmed as the next attorney general of the , replacing  who was fired by President Donald Trump in November.Mr Barr, who served as attorney general during the George HW Bush administration, was confirmed by the US Senate in a vote on Thursday. Three Democrats –  of Virginia,  of Alabama and  of Arizona – voted with Republicans to endorse him, though Republican  voted against.Mr Barr will take up the position at the helm of the department of justice at a crucial time for the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. As Mr Trump’s nominee, he came under questioning during his senate confirmation hearing last month for suggesting that special counsel Robert Mueller’s final report may not be published in full when the investigation concludes.His confirmation as Mr Sessions’ successor took place hours after former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe revealed that senior department of justice officials – including Mr Barr’s new deputy,  – discussed the possibility of asking cabinet members to invoke the 25th amendment of the constitution, which allows presidents to be removed from office, after  fired FBI director  in 2017.Mr McCabe made the comments in an interview with ABC ahead of the publication of his memoir, which will be published next week.But Mr Rosenstein disputed the account yesterday, describing Mr McCabe’s version of events as “inaccurate and factually incorrect”.Mr Trump also hit out at the former deputy FBI director, who was fired by Mr Sessions last year, a day before he was due to retire, describing him as a “disgrace to the FBI and a disgrace to our country”.The former deputy to Mr Comey is under investigation by the FBI’s internal watchdog for improperly leaking information and is due to publish a new book next week.Mr McCabe also confirmed a s report last year that the FBI began investigating if the US president was working for  after the firing of Mr Comey and before the establishment of the special counsel investigation.“I was very concerned that I was able to put the Russia case on absolutely solid ground in an indelible fashion that, were I removed quickly or reassigned or fired, that the case could not be closed or vanish in the night without a trace,” he said in the CBS interview.The developments took place a day after Mr Trump’s former campaign manager  was found guilty of lying to prosecutors in breach of a plea deal he had reached with investigators.The former lobbyist misled prosecutors about the nature of his contacts with a Russian intelligence operative, after agreeing to co-operate with them, a court in Washington heard on Wednesday. Judge  Jackson agreed with the prosecution team that Mr Manafort had lied about three separate issues related to the Russia investigation, including his interactions with , a Russian individual who has been indicted by the US and is suspected of being a Russian operative.Mr Manafort’s breach of his plea deal means that he is likely to face a much tougher prison sentence than previously thought probable.Mr Manafort pleaded guilty in September, on the eve of jury selection for his trial, to various crimes including conspiring to defraud the United States and the violation of lobbying laws. He is facing a separate set of charges in Virginia.The 69-year-old has been in prison in Virginia since June, where he is being held in solitary confinement.He is due to be sentenced by Judge Berman Jackson on March 13th. Subscribe.    </doc>

Photograph: Amir Cohen, Israel’s former top general, wants to end Binyamin Netanyahu’s decades-long dominance of Israeli politics.Gantz (59), who has no political experience and has been reluctant to provide details on his policy platform, only entered politics in December, setting up a new centrist party,  Resilience, which last month merged with another centrist party, Yesh Atid, to form Blue and White, after the colours of the Israeli flag.With less than a month to go before the April 9th Knesset elections, polls show the Blue and White alliance will emerge as the largest party, enjoying a lead of between three to five seats over Mr Netanyahu’s ruling  party, although the overall right-religious and centre-left blocs remain evenly matched.Good-looking, tall and blue-eyed, Gantz projects an image of calm and trustworthiness. His is a fresh face, untainted by corruption and the dirty deals of Israeli politics, and with an illustrious military career to boot.He was born in Kfar Ahim, a moshav co-operative agricultural community between Tel Aviv and Gaza, in 1959.His parents were Holocaust survivors: his mother from  and his father from .“In many ways, my life began before I was born,” Gantz said. “It began the moment my mother Malka walked out of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. I will always remember the ones who never came out.”Gantz had a humble upbringing, and before enlisting in the army he was sent to an agricultural boarding school by his father, who thought he was growing up spoilt, surrounded by his three sisters.According to relatives, he received “a Mediterranean education”, as he often skipped classes to head for the beach.In the army he joined the paratroopers, and his first assignment as a young recruit was to participate in securing Egyptian president Anwar Sadat’s historic visit to Israel in 1977.In 1991 he led the commando unit that was on the ground in  for 36 hours, during which 14,000 Ethiopian Jews were secretly airlifted to Israel.In 2000, when Israel ended 18 years of military presence in , he was the last soldier to cross the border and shut the gates.Gantz gained a reputation as a cautious commander and a gentleman during his rise through the ranks. Former general , number two on the rival Labour list, welcomed Gantz’s entry into politics.“We want at the wheel someone who knows how to navigate and Benny has this. Some people see the fact that he’s a mensch and his gentle nature as weakness: I see it as strength.”But there were also controversial incidents during Gantz’s military career that are being used today by his political opponents to question his suitability to lead the country.In 2000, Gantz was the army’s West Bank commander when a 19-year-old Druze border guard, Madhat Yusuf, died after being injured in clashes at Joseph’s Tomb in .Yusuf bled to death while Israel negotiated for more than five hours with the Palestinian security forces over a safe evacuation for him.“Benny Gantz was one of those commanders who turned his back on him [Yusuf],” claimed Likud minister .By the time of the 2014 Gaza war, Gantz was the army’s chief of staff. It became clear during the course of the campaign that the military had underestimated the Hamas tunnel threat and was not ready to locate and destroy the tunnels, some of which reached under the border into Israel.Naftali Bennett, the head of the New Right party, said Gantz’s 51 days of “indecision” during the war led to a stalemate.“Gantz is Hamas’s wet dream,” Bennett said. “If Hamas leaders could vote they would vote for Benny Gantz, the hesitant general.”Critics also point out that before entering politics Gantz became the chairman of a Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity company that declared bankruptcy after three years.With support from the left and centre guaranteed, Gantz realised that his only hope of toppling Netanyahu was to attract voters from the right.He played up his military credentials, posting video clips entitled Only the Strong Prevail which boasted about the number of “terrorists” killed in the Gaza war, without mention of the high number of civilian casualties, and showed Gaza neighbourhoods in ruins.“No Israeli leader is king,” Gantz declared in his inaugural election speech. “I thank prime minister  for his 10 years of service. We’ll take it from here.”Gantz vowed that a government he headed would strive to achieve peace and regional change, but if peace was not possible at this juncture he committed to strengthening West Bank settlement blocs and keeping control of the Jordan Valley and the Golan Heights.Netanyahu has said the choice is now clearer than ever: a strong right-wing government led by him or a weak left-wing government headed by Gantz.The Israeli electorate will decide next month. Subscribe.    </doc>

He’s talking about the . And he’s delivering a bombshell. Although the book’s publishers have kept it under tight wraps, I obtained a copy in advance of its release next Thursday. It will come out in eight languages and 20 countries, under the title Sodoma, as in Sodom, in some western European states and as In the Closet of the Vatican in Britain, the US, and . It includes the claim that about 80 per cent of the male  clergy members who work at the Vatican, around the pope, are gay. It contends that the more showily homophobic a Vatican official is, the more likely he belongs to that crowd, and that the higher up the chain of command you go, the more gays you find. And not all of them are celibate. Not by a long shot.I’m supposed to cheer, right? I’m an openly gay man. I’m a sometime Church critic. Hooray for the exposure of hypocrisy in high places and the affirmation that some of our tormentors have tortured motives. Thank heaven for the challenge to their moral authority. Let the sun in. Let the truth out.But I’m bothered and even a little scared. Whatever Martel’s intent, In the Closet of the Vatican may be less a constructive reckoning than a stockpile of ammunition for militant right-wing Catholics who already itch to conduct a witch-hunt for gay priests, many of whom are exemplary – and chaste – servants of the Church. Those same Catholics oppose necessary reforms, and may cite the book’s revelations as proof that the Church is already too permissive and has lost its dignity and its way.Although Martel himself is openly gay, he sensationalises gayness by devoting his inquiry to Catholic officials who have had sex with men, not ones who have had sex with women. The promise of celibacy that priests make forbids all sexual partners, and what violates Catholic teaching isn’t just gay sex but sex outside marriage. In that context, Martel’s focus on homosexuality buys into the notion that it’s especially troubling and titillating.His tone doesn’t help. “The world I am discovering, with its 50 shades of gay, is beyond comprehension,” he writes. It will seem to some readers “a fairytale”. He challenges the conventional wisdom that , who has detractors all around him, is “among the wolves”, clarifying: “It’s not quite true: he’s among the queens.” Maybe it’s better in the original French, but this language is at once profoundly silly and deeply offensive.The sourcing of much of In the Closet of the Vatican is vague, and other Vatican experts told me that the 80 per cent figure is neither knowable nor credible. “It’s not a scientifically based accusation – it’s an ideologically based one,” said the Rev , a former columnist for the National Catholic Reporter who visits the Vatican frequently and has written several books about the Roman Catholic hierarchy. “One of the problems is that Catholic bishops have never allowed any kind of research in this area. They don’t want to know how many gay priests there are.” Independent studies put the percentage of gay men among Catholic priests in the US at 15 to 60 per cent.In a telephone interview, Martel stressed that the 80 per cent isn’t his estimate but that of a former priest at the Vatican whom he quotes by name in the book. But he presents that quotation without sufficient scepticism and, in his own words, writes that “it’s a big majority”.He says that In the Closet of the Vatican is informed by about 1,500 interviews over four years and the contributions of scores of researchers and other assistants. I covered the Vatican for The New York Times for nearly two years, and the book has a richness of detail that’s persuasive. It’s going to be widely discussed and hotly debated.It depicts different sexual subcultures, including clandestine meetings between Vatican officials and young heterosexual Muslim men who work as sex workers. It names names, and while many belong to Vatican officials and others who are dead or whose sexual identities have come under public scrutiny before, Martel also lavishes considerable energy on the suggestion that Francis’s predecessor,  XVI, is gay.Perhaps the most vivid of the double lives under Martel’s gaze is that of  López Trujillo of , who died a little more than a decade ago. According to the book, he prowled the ranks of seminarians and young priests for men to seduce and routinely hired male sex workers, sometimes beating them up after sex. All the while he promoted the Church’s teaching that all gay men are “objectively disordered” and embraced its ban on priests who are believed to have “deep-seated homosexual tendencies”, whether they act on them or not.Part of my concern about the book is the timing of its release, which coincides precisely with an unprecedented meeting at the Vatican about sexual abuse in the Church. For the first time, the pope has summoned the presidents of every Catholic bishops’ conference across the world to discuss this topic alone. But the book is “bound to shift attention away from child abuse and onto gay priests in general, once again falsely conflating in people’s minds homosexuality and paedophilia”, the Rev , a bestselling Jesuit author, said in a recent tweet. He’s right.The book doesn’t equate them, and in fact makes the different, important point that the Church’s culture of secrecy – a culture created in part by gay priests’ need to conceal who they are – works against the exposure of molesters who are guilty of crimes.As , a longtime advocate for survivors of sexual abuse by priests, said to me: “Many priests have a huge disincentive to report sexual misdeeds by colleagues. They know they’re vulnerable to being blackballed. It’s celibacy and the secretive, rigid, ancient all-male hierarchy that contributes to the cover-up.” Abuse has no sexual orientation, a fact made clear by the many cases of priests having sex with girls and adult women, including nuns, whose victimisation was publicly acknowledged by Pope Francis for the first time early this month.But that’s a crucial subtlety that’s too easily lost in the thicket of exclamation points in Martel’s book. And more people will read the racy headlines about it than read the book itself. What they may take away is this: Catholic priests are twisted. And gay men are agents of deception who band together in eccentric societies with odd rituals.I asked Martel what his aim was. “I’m a journalist,” he said. “My only goal is to write stories. I’m not a Catholic. I don’t have any motive of revenge. My concern is not that the Church will be better or worse.” I asked him if he worried about homophobes weaponising the book. If they read it correctly, he answered, they’ll realise that rooting out gays would mean ridding the Church of some of their heroes, who inveigh against homosexuality as a way of denying and camouflaging who they really are. The cardinals most accepting of gays, he said, are those who are probably straight.All else aside, the book speaks to the enormous tension between a Church that frequently vilifies and marginalises gay men and a priesthood dense with them. “This fact hangs in the air as a giant, unsustainable paradox,” , who is Catholic and gay, wrote in an excellent cover story for New York magazine last month. It explains why so many gay men entered the priesthood, especially decades ago: they didn’t feel safe in a society that ostracised them. Their sense of being outsiders gave them a more spiritual bent and greater desire to help others in need.They weren’t pulling off some elaborate ruse or looking for the clerical equivalent of a bathhouse. They were trying, psychologically and emotionally, to survive. Many still are, and I fear that In the Closet of the Vatican won’t help. – New York Times Subscribe.    </doc>

Photograph: Luc Gnago/Reuters was thrown into disarray on Saturday after its presidential election was delayed just hours before polls were set to open, in a dramatic late-night move that drew accusations of sabotage from the two leading candidates and sparked frustration among voters.The decision could upend the lives of millions of Nigerians who had returned to their hometowns in order to vote in presidential and parliamentary elections, many at great personal cost in a country with 87 million people living in extreme poverty.While appealing for calm, the two major party candidates and their surrogates lashed out at each other. A spokesman for Muhammadu Buhari, who is seeking a second term, said he had received the announcement “with great disappointment”, and suggested that “this postponement has been orchestrated with the main opposition” party.Opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar said the delay was proof of his repeated accusation that the president of attempting to rig the election.“By instigating this postponement, the Buhari administration hopes to disenfranchise the Nigerian electorate in order to ensure that turnout is low on the rescheduled date,” he said in a statement. “They are desperate and will do anything in their power to avoid their rejection by the Nigerian people.“Their plan is to provoke the public, hoping for a negative reaction, and then use that as an excuse for further anti-democratic acts.”The independent national electoral commission chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, said early on Saturday morning that the delay was needed because of logistical and operational concerns, in order to ensure the vote would be free and fair. “The commission came to the conclusion that proceeding with the election as scheduled is no longer feasible,”  said.A senior diplomat said discussions of a delay began because eight states and the Federal Capital Territory have “distribution issues related to sensitive materials”.Mr Buhari has repeatedly promised free and fair elections, but fears of fraud persist across the country.Though vote-buying and voter intimidation remain common, international observers say Nigeria’s electoral system is far more robust than it was in past elections, including 2007 when, many Nigerians believe, an election criticised for widespread irregularities was stolen from Mr Buhari when he was the main opposition candidate.A senior international observer in Nigeria said the delay would be considered suspicious as it extended beyond two or three days, “but [the electoral commission] is terrible at logistics, [there were] delays in both 2011 and 2015 . . . [a short] delay is not uncommon”.The 2011 election was delayed by a week because of logistical and security issues. In 2015, the election was delayed by six weeks because of the Boko Haram jihadist insurgency.“This is better than going forward and chaos tomorrow,” the international observer said.On Friday as Nigerians speculated online on whether the election would be held, some observers questioned what it said about the country.“Whether elections hold tomorrow or are postponed it is a shame on @inecnigeria that there is suspense &amp; uncertainty about whether elections will hold less than 24 hours to the polls,” wrote , head of the Open Society Initiative of west . “Irresponsible &amp; indicative of the dysfunction &amp; usual ineptitude that characterises government.”The night before the election, 66 people were killed in eight villages in  state in the north, in an act of apparent banditry, which is afflicting wide swaths of the country’s northwest. The incident was not thought to be election-related, nor to have had any bearing on the electoral commission’s decision. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019 Subscribe.    </doc>

Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP PhotoUS president  has said he is “not happy” with a compromise spending agreement struck by congressional negotiators on Monday but indicated that he may still endorse it to avoid a government shutdown on Friday.Democrats and Republicans reached agreement “in principle” on Monday evening on a spending deal that would ensure the government will remain funded after Friday when the current set of temporary funding Bills expire.The deal includes $1.375 billion for a physical border with  – far less than the $5.7 billion demanded by Mr Trump for his proposed wall. The agreement also envisages a reduction in the number of migrants that can be detained by immigration and customs enforcement officers, a key demand of Democrats and an issue that had led to the breakdown of talks over the weekend.But any Bill must be signed off by the US president.Mr Trump gave his first detailed response to the proposal at the  on Tuesday. “Am I happy at first glance? The answer is no, I’m not, I’m not happy,” he said in response to questions from reporters. “It’s not going to do the trick, but I’m adding things to it and when you add whatever I have to add, it’s all going to happen where we’re going to build a beautiful, big, strong wall.”The prospect that Mr Trump would sign the Bill and then introduce separate measures to tap alternative sources of funding for the wall emerged as a distinct possibility. Officials have noted that the president is reluctant to shut down the government, three weeks after the longest government shutdown in US history ended.“I don’t think you’re going to see a shutdown. I wouldn’t want to see a shutdown. If you did have it, it’s the Democrats’ fault,” Mr Trump told reporters. He was due to speak further with congressional Republicans on Tuesday, who are encouraging him to sign up to the agreement.“I hope he signs the Bill,”  majority leader Mitch McConnell said, but he said the president should also feel free to use any political tools he needed to build the wall.Various executive actions up to and including declaring a national emergency are under consideration by the White House.The breakthrough in negotiations in Washington on Monday night took place as Mr Trump held a rally in  Texas. Flanked by enormous red banners with the phrase “Finish the Wall,” Mr Trump told the crowd: “Today, we started the big, beautiful wall right on the Rio Grande”, a reference to the river that separates the US from Mexico in Texas.In a free-flowing speech he claimed that 60,000 people had applied to attend the rally, but only 10,000 had been permitted to enter. “Is there anywhere more fun than a Trump rally?” he said to cheers.But it later emerged that a BBC cameraman had been attacked by a Trump supporter who had entered the press area during the rally.The BBC said cameraman  was “violently pushed and shoved by a member of the crowd” while covering the event. In a statement, the White House Correspondents’ Association said it “condemns the physical attack on our colleague at the president’s rally in El Paso, Texas. We are relieved that, this time, no one was seriously hurt. The president of the  should make absolutely clear to his supporters that violence against reporters is unacceptable.”During the rally, Mr Trump also mocked Beto O’Rourke, the former Congressman who is widely believed to be considering a run for president in 2020.The former congressman held his own rally less than a mile away from the El Paso County Coliseum where Mr. Trump was speaking. “We stand for America and we stand against walls,” the El Paso native said as he addressed a crowd of about 10,000 people. Subscribe.    </doc>

Its unanimous judgment dismissing the man’s appeal over his wardship and detention addresses important issues, with effects for other cases, concerning the intersection between the High Court’s wardship jurisdiction and mental health laws.Lawyers for the man accepted his detention in the CMH was appropriate but the dispute was about the legal mechanism for that. They argued his rights would be better protected under mental health legislation.Giving the judgment, Mr Justice John MacMenamin said a lot of the problem arose because, while the man met criteria for detention under the Mental Health Act 2001, that provided he could not be admitted directly to the CMH and must first be taken for assessment to an “approved” centre. Psychiatrists told the  they had been informed by the HSE assessment had been “explored” but it appeared none of the approved centres were willing to take him for security reasons.The HSE’s “eleventh hour” application for wardship in late 2016 left the president of the High Court, Mr Justice Peter Kelly, in an “invidious” position with little choice but to grant it, Mr Justice MacMenamin said. Otherwise, the man, deemed very dangerous, could have been released within four days into the community with “potentially catastrophic”” consequences for himself and others. There was no direct evidence before the High Court regarding the HSE’s attempted compliance with the provisions of the 2001 Act, he said.There was sufficient material before the High Court to show it was not possible to operate the provisions of the 2001 Act and Mr Justice Kelly’s description of the relevant provisions as “unwieldy” was “an understatement”. While it was possible some of those provisions were inspired by “overriding concerns” about overcrowding in the CMH, the High Court was owed a “much fuller” explanation about why “this crux” had risen but had no time to seek that. The courts have inherent jurisdiction to be used only as a “backstop” when statutes do not govern a particular situation but, in this case, there was a statutory regime of wardship, he said.The wardship and detention orders were “necessary and appropriate” and the High Court had no other legal option but to make them.The orders were also necessary to vindicate the man’s right to life and welfare and to protect the rights and welfare of others.Fair procedures were observed and provision was made for the man to be legally represented, he held.While the man undoubtedly met the criteria for admission to the CMH as defined in the 2001 Act, the requirements for wardship orders, on the evidence before the High Court including he was of “unsound mind”, were also satisfied. Under wardship, the safeguards and protections as regards procedural rights, review by the courts, consent and treatment could be no less than if he was admitted to the CMH under the MHA, the judge said.The fact wardship is a separate jurisdiction does not prevent the High Court adopting “”mirror” procedures to vindicate the constitutional and ECHR rights of wards of court and Mr Justice Kelly set out a list of those, he added. Without such protections, questions might arise concerning compliance with the Constitution and ECHR, he stressed.In cases of minors at risk in the last two decades, the exercise of the High Court’s inherent jurisdiction became “the rule” and “a first, not a last resort”, he observed. Subscribe.    </doc>

Photograph: Collins The  has ruled that Catherine Nevin’s conviction for the murder of her husband can be relied on by his family in their bid to ensure her estate does not benefit from his. The full hearing of the civil disinheritance proceedings will be heard later.A five-judge Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously dismissed an appeal on behalf of the executors of Ms Nevin’s estate against a finding the conviction was admissible in those proceedings as evidence of Ms Nevin’s guilt of the murder of her husband Tom.Tom Nevin’s brother Patrick was in court for the judgment.Lawyers for Ms Nevin’s estate had argued the conviction does not amount to proof of her guilt of Tom Nevin’s murder and was proof only that she was “found guilty”. Ms Nevin died in a hospice in February 2018 having been given compassionate temporary release from her life sentence. Giving the Supreme Court judgment, Ms Justice Iseult O’Malley pointed out the ruling sought by the Nevin family relates only to the admissibility of the murder conviction “in civil proceedings”.The proper approach to the relevant provision of the Succession Act, Section 120, remains to be determined, she stressed.The court’s judgment, she further stressed, is concerned only with the situation that arises where a defendant, whose conviction is proposed to be proved, maintains their innocence of the crime.An admission of guilt is always admissible as an admission against interest in an estate, she said.In this case, she was satisfied evidence of the conviction “is in principle admissible”.While proof of a conviction might in one sense be seen simply as evidence of jury opinion, it is an opinion that carries far greater weight than that of a witness in a hearing by virtue of the nature of the process by which it is produced, she said.On the other hand, its relevance may be open to dispute depending on the facts of the individual case, she said. A trial judge in a civil action may have to consider whether the facts set out in the order of conviction are sufficiently related to the issue to be determined. If not, admission of the record may be refused, the judge said.The appeal was over a Court of Appeal finding that the criminal conviction can be relied on in the civil disinheritance proceedings as proof of Ms Nevin’s guilt of the murder of her husband in March 1996. was convicted in 2000 of the murder after a 42-day trial in the Central . That was the third trial as two earlier trials were aborted.Tom Nevin’s mother, Nora, initiated proceedings in November 1997 seeking that Catherine Nevin be disinherited. Mr Nevin died intestate and the couple had no children which generally means the entire estate goes to the widow. Mr Nevin was murdered in 1996 at Jack White’s Inn in Brittas, Co Wicklow, the pub jointly owned by the couple. Mrs Nevin re-opened the pub for a short time before it was sold in 1997 for IR£620,000.

" date = "Mon 25/3/2019">    he UK voted to leave the European Union on June 23 2016 by a majority of 51.9 to 48.1 per cent, with a turnout of just under 72 per cent. This set the UK on course to leave the EU, but left all the details of its exit still to be decided. The timetable was set the following March 29th, when British prime minister Theresa May took the formal step, required under EU law to start the exit process, of triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Under the two-year process the UK will leave the EU on March 29, 2019. An extension to the exit period is possible if all 28 EU members agree. However negotiations have been taking place on the assumption that the UK leaves in March 2019. The talks between the UK and EU started in June 2017 and so far have focused on the details of the UK’s withdrawal, which must be set down in a formal, legal agreement. Outline agreement has been reached on what the UK will pay the EU after departure – the so-called exit bill or divorce bill – and on the mutual recognition of the rights of UK citizens in the EU and EU citizens in the UK.In November, agreement was also reached on a backstop for the Irish border, a way to provide a guarantee that there be no hard border on the island of Ireland no matter what future trade arrangements are agreed between the EU and UK. This cleared the way for a draft withdrawal agreement and final talks on a political declaration outlining the principles for future negotiations. This draft needs to be ratified politically by both sides.Under the withdrawal agreement, a so-called transition period, a kind of standstill in current arrangements, would apply from March 2019 until December 2020, or 2022 if it is extended. This is to allow future trade arrangements and the wider ongoing relationship between the EU and UK to be negotiated. Read a full ) . The withdrawal agreement also contains a provision known as the backstop, but more on that later.or a country to leave the EU is unprecedented ‑ and the extent of the complications has slowly become evident in the last couple of years. EU membership is a central part of the economy and society of all its members and unscrambling this is very complex, before account is even taken of sketching out how the two sides will relate to each other in future.Much of the discussion has been about the UK’s membership of the EU trading bloc. There are two elements to this. First, the UK is part of the EU customs union. This is a free trade area under which allows goods to circulate freely through the EU. Part of this is a commitment by all members to impose the same import tariffs – or taxes – on goods entering from outside the EU.The UK is also part of the EU single market, the system of rules and regulations which allow free movement of goods, services, people and capital. Together, membership of the customs union and single market allows goods to move freely across the EU and also for free trade in services like banking. Common EU regulations also underpin trade in a host of different areas, for example pharmaceuticals and food.The single market also allows free movement of people across the EU. The UK is also involved in common international policies co-ordinated at EU level, notably in foreign policy and defence and in trade deals with other countries.rexit talks between the UK and the EU are taking place in a sequenced order, which has led to no little confusion in the debate.What has been agreed are the draft terms on which the UK leaves, contained in the withdrawal agreement. A political declaration on what the future relationship might look like has also been finalised. However, details of the future relationship between the EU and UK will be decided in talks after the UK actually leaves ‑  assuming the two sides are still talking.In the short term the conclusion of the withdrawal agreement would mean that once the UK leaves in March 2019 a transition period, a kind of standstill, would commence and last until the end of 2020. The draft withdrawal agreement also suggests that this transition period could be extended until 2022. If the agreement is ratified and the transition period kicks in, not much will change on March 29th, except for the UK’s formal departure.f there is no withdrawal agreement, then the UK would leave the EU in a so-called “no-deal” Brexit in March 2019, which could be chaotic as barriers to trade would go up overnight and there would be uncertainties in areas ranging from aviation to pharmaceuticals to co-operation in nuclear regulation. There is speculation that the EU and UK would work together to try to avoid the worst of the chaos – though they could only do so much ‑  or even that there might be late moves to delay the UK’s exit date.If a withdrawal agreement is finalised, then talks move on to how the two sides will relate in future in areas such as foreign policy, defence and security and, crucially for Ireland, trade. (Follow  would mean for Ireland) n terms of trade, the UK could have a close relationship with the EU – like Norway, which follows many EU rules and regulations and is in the single market – or have a free trade deal with the EU, like Canada. (Read our ) The crunch point is that the EU insists that the UK must either be fully in the EU trading bloc and accept all the rules, or be out of it, and have a relationship similar to the EU and Canada. For the UK, the more closely aligned it remains with the EU, the less freedom it will have to set its own economic course after Brexit.he UK’s departure from the EU means Northern Ireland is leaving the bloc too so checks would be required along the 499-kilometre Irish Border as different trade rules would apply north and south after Brexit. The Border in Ireland will become the only land border between the UK and the EU after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement laid the foundation for Northern Ireland’s peace process with many all-island rules and institutions. Neither side wants the return of border checks because of the risk to peace whereby a physical border infrastructure would be considered a potential target for paramilitaries.The Backstop is an insurance policy that the EU and UK have agreed to include in the withdrawal agreement to avoid this happening. Both sides see it as a last resort to be triggered in the event of no better solution being found to avoid a hard border in a EU-UK trade deal. But there is a sequencing problem: a withdrawal treaty must be agreed before a trade deal, hence the need for the backstop first. (Follow )he economic impact of Brexit is negative, for both the UK, Ireland and the rest of the EU. The biggest impact will be in the UK itself and in Ireland, its closest trading partner.  For the UK, any trade arrangement reached after Brexit – barring full membership of the EU trading bloc, which the UK has ruled out – will be less favourable than current arrangements. Economists say that any new trade opportunities elsewhere will not make up for losses in trade with the EU. Weaker sterling since Brexit has already cut the purchasing power of UK consumers and uncertainty has hit investment, with growth estimated to be 1 to 2 per cent per annum lower over the couple of years.For Ireland, growth remains strong and the main short-term impact has been via a weaker sterling exchange rate, which is good if you’re going to the UK to buy a second-hand car but bad if you’re an exporter to the UK market. The main threat to Brexit comes from barriers to exports to the UK and also delays and higher prices for importers of UK goods to Ireland. Forecasters have estimated that in a harder version of Brexit, where the UK leaves the EU trading bloc, the Irish economy could be 4 to 7 per cent lower in a decade’s time, with most of the hit in the first five years. A no-deal Brexit means the economic effect would be more severe and happen more quicklyTheresa May has scheduled a second “meaningful vote” on her Brexit deal for this date after the UK parliament rejected the withdrawal agreement brokered with the EU by 432 votes to 202 on January 15th.If May’s deal is rejected by British MPs, the House of Commons will be asked on this date if it supports leaving the EU without a deal on March 29.If this vote is rejected, MPs will be asked to vote on a "short, limited extension" to the Article 50 process, delaying Brexit to no later than the end of June, May has said. The Irish Government is targeting the passage of the hard Brexit’ emergency legislation by the Oireachtas by this date.Brexit - the United Kingdom is scheduled to leave the European Union. If a deal is reached, the 21-month standstill transition period kicks in, maintaining the existing EU-UK relationship while both sides try to hammer out a future trading agreement. This is the date that May has said would be the latest date that the Brexit Article 50 process can be delayed until, if MPs reject her divorce deal in the March 12 vote, reject leaving the EU without a deal on March 13 and vote for an extension to Article 50 on March 14th. Under the draft Brexit agreement, the UK and EU can, before this date, request an extension to the transition period "of up to one or two years to the transition period".  If the EU and UK have agreed a Brexit treaty and agree a future trading relationship, this is the earliest date by which the transition period will end.  the date the EU’s chief negotiator has proposed extending the Brexit transition to in order to allow the EU and UK negotiate a trading deal. Under the withdrawal agreement this is the latest date on which the transition period can end. If it were extended until 2022 it would mean that the UK would stay within the single market and customs union for six and a half years after the Brexit vote.    </doc>

This week’s EU Council didn’t so much kick the can down the road as nudge it on a few yards past the neighbour’s house. Time is still very short. And the risk now is that powerful forces in the UK and EU just want Brexit over and done with – and in this atmposhere there are risks of big mistakes being made.The week ahead is shaping up as vital, although a little more wriggle room has been left as EU leaders pushed the responsibility right back at the UK.If the House of Commons rejects the withdrawal agreement, as it well might, then the risk of a no-deal exit is back – just on April 12th instead of March 29th.

By any measure, that is a significant sum of money, and while we have heard of people buying them under the bike-to-work scheme, a step which would see the cost fall by half and allow you to spread the payments out over a year, we are not sure if the Department of Transport would approve. They are easy to use and will allow you get from A to B (as long as A is not too far from B) without breaking a sweat. As far as we can tell they are no more dangerous than riding a bike – perhaps even less so as you take up less space on the road and have a shorter distance to fall if things go wrong. At 12kg it is pretty lightweight and very portable, which means you won’t have to leave it outside for long stretches where it can fall victim to thieves. Of course, that means you will have to take it with you wherever you go, which can make a shopping experience tiresome.

He is best known for the mathematical techniques that he developed in his analytical theory of heat transfer. Over the past two centuries, his methods have evolved into a major subject, harmonic analysis, with widespread applications in number theory, signal processing, quantum mechanics, weather prediction and a broad range of other fields.In his mathematical theory of heat conduction, Fourier based his reasoning on Newton’s law of cooling, with the flow of heat between two adjacent particles being proportional to the difference in temperature. He wrote that “heat, like gravity, penetrates every substance of the universe, its rays occupy all parts of space”. He established the fundamental equation that governs the diffusion or spreading out of heat, and solved it by using the infinite series of trigonometric functions that we now call Fourier series.Sign up for just  for the first month.      </doc>

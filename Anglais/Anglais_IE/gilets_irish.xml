Mr Di Maio and , a prominent  member, met Christophe Chalençon, as well as candidates that the protest movement has put forward for the European elections in May, on the outskirts of Paris on Tuesday. Posting a photograph of the group on , Mr Di Maio described it as a “beautiful” meeting.“The wind of change has crossed the Alps. I repeat. The wind of change has crossed the Alps,” he wrote.Mr Di Maio had previously expressed his admiration for the gilets jaunes, who have been holding at-times violent anti-government protests each week across France for the past few months. He urged the movement not to “give up” and said the demonstrations reminded him of the spirit that gave birth to the Five Star Movement in 2009.On Tuesday he said the two groups shared “many common positions and values that focus on the battles for citizens, social rights, direct democracy and the environment”.Mr Chalençon said that while the two sides “practically agree on everything”, there was no talk yet about whether they would form an alliance for the elections to the . Italian media reported that , who heads the gilets jaunes’ list of 10 candidates for the elections, will meet M5S officials again in Rome next week.The meeting follows a series of verbal attacks from Mr Di Maio and his co-deputy prime minister, , on the French president, , in recent weeks and is also seen as an additional tactic by M5S to regain some of the popularity lost to Mr Salvini’s far-right League since the coalition government came to power last June.“M5S is weak right now,” said , a politics professor at Luiss University in Rome. “They are losing traction in their traditionally antagonistic contingencies and they need to find every antagonistic issue to demonstrate that they are strong. Macron is also the perfect target for populist movements.”Mr Panarari added that the meeting with the gilets jaunes was also a way to tell Italian voters that the Five Star Movement still has its “anti-establishment soul” as well as to attract similar groups with whom they might be able to build a coalition after the EU elections.M5S launched its European election campaign in January, with Mr Di Maio and Mr Di Battista travelling to the European Parliament in  and denouncing the institution as a “waste of money”. At the time, Mr Di Maio said he was preparing an election manifesto with other European populist groups.Opinion polls in France have suggested that the main impact of one or more gilets jaunes candidates standing in the European elections would be to reduce support for the far-right of  and the far left, led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon.A survey last month by Elabé showed 13 per cent of voters could vote for a gilets jaunes party, knocking three points off the score of Ms Le Pen’s National Rally and 1.5 points off that of Mr Mélenchon’s France Unbowed, and extending the lead of Mr Macron’s . “A gilets jaunes party would likely mobilise people who do not usually vote, but also take votes from the National Rally and France Unbowed,” Emmanuel Rivière of pollsters Kantar Public France told . “Paradoxically, the principal beneficiary would be the party of the president.”An Ifop opinion poll published on Wednesday showed Macron’s approval rating surging from 23 per cent in December to 34 per cent in February. – Guardian  Subscribe.

Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty ImagesShouts of “Macron resign!” and “Macron get lost!” punctuated the booms from tear gas and water cannons on the Champs-Élysées on Saturday, as French police forced protesters from the “Yellow Vests” movement away from the presidential offices in the Élysée Palace.Welling up rapidly from rural and forgotten , this broad-based, citizen-driven movement is among the most serious challenges yet to President Emmanuel Macron’s pro-business government, say analysts, political opponents and even many of Macron’s supporters.On Saturday, thousands of the “gilets jaunes”, or Yellow Vests, named for the fluorescent road-safety vests that all French drivers must carry in their vehicles, converged on Paris for a second weekend to protest a rise in fuel taxes and to express general discontent with the fiscal burden in one of the most highly taxed states in Europe, where taxes represent over 45 percent of GDP.The numbers had dropped sharply from the preceding week’s several hundred thousand protesters; police estimated there were about 8,000 in Paris and more than 80,000 across the country on Saturday.Clouds of gas and smoke rolled up the Champs-Élysées all afternoon as police battled militant members of the crowd wielding paving stones; the grassroots protesters insisted they were unconnected with their movement.“We’re just fed up. It seems like to us that the government is only working to maintain its own privileges,” said Mathieu Styrna, one of the thousands marching. A contractor, he said he had been forced to drive hundreds of miles a week for work and could no longer afford his gas bills.It is the movement’s amorphousness that makes it new, powerful and potentially dangerous for Macron, analysts say. “The government parties didn’t understand that their tax policies would wind up producing this,” said Dominique Reynie, a political scientist at Sciences Po, saying the tax burden had grown by about €25 billion every year between 2002 and 2017.No high-ranking official has met with any of the self-designated spokespeople for the movement who have been appearing on French television all week. There have been a few small fiscal gestures – promises of checks and rebates – but these were dismissed by Saturday’s protesters as irrelevant to their daily struggle.“It’s going to trigger a civil war and me, like most other citizens, we’re all ready,” said , a 21-year-old protester from .Mr Macron has insisted that the fuel tax rises are a necessary pain to reduce France’s dependence on fossil fuels and fund renewable energy investments, which is a cornerstone of his reforms of the nation. He will defend fresh plans to make the “energy transition” easier on Tuesday.A man caused a dramatic stand-off with police on Friday when he donned a neon vest and brandished an apparent grenade at a supermarket in the western city of .

Photograph: Riccardo Antimiani/EPA Historically and culturally,  and  are extremely close. Trade between the two countries represents a whopping €200 million daily. Yet relations between them have deteriorated almost to breaking point.The French foreign ministry summoned the Italian ambassador for a dressing down this week, after , the leader of Italy’s populist Five Star Movement (M5S), as well as a deputy prime minister and minister for economic development, labour and social policy, blamed France for the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean.France’s ambassador to Rome was summoned in a similar fashion twice last year, when tempers frayed over a border incident and Italy’s refusal to allow the migrant ship Aquarius to dock.After several boats carrying migrants sank in the Mediterranean recently, claiming at least 170 lives, Mr Di Maio denounced French “hypocrisy” and “crocodile tears”.“If today people are leaving, it’s because certain European countries, chief among them France, never stopped colonising dozens of African countries,” Mr Di Maio said on January 20th, calling for EU sanctions against France. “France prints the currency, the colonial franc, in dozens of African countries, and with this currency they finance the French debt . . . If France didn’t have the African colonies, she would be the world’s 15th economic power, but she’s among the first because of what she’s doing in . ”Mr Di Maio’s coalition partner , head of the far-right Lega, and who is also a deputy prime minister and the minister of the interior, added his own insults, calling on his  page for the French to “liberate themselves from a very bad president in the next European elections”.  “preaches about solidarity, but turns back thousands of migrants”, Mr Salvini said.Mr Macron has portrayed European elections in May as a contest between his camp, which he defines as liberal, pro-European and progressive, and Mr Salvini’s, which he portrays as narrow-minded, nationalist and populist. Last summer, he referred to the M5S-Lega coalition as “leprosy”.On January 7th, Mr Di Maio urged French  demonstrators to “hang in there”. He offered them logistical support to create a website comparable to the Rousseau platform used by M5S to come to power.“The M5S platform advocates shutting down parliament and replacing it with direct democracy, because the politicians are stuffing their pockets. The have invented nothing new,” says , director of projects at the pro-EU think tank Volta Italia.Salvini and Di Maio have different reasons for antagonising the French. “Salvini is allied with [French far-right leader] . He wants to lead the nationalists in , and he and Macron are sworn enemies,” says Ms Maurel.“Di Maio is losing ground to Salvini, and he has understood that being anti-French pays politically, so he’s using outrageous statements as a publicity stunt,” Ms Maurel continues. “Confrontation is . . . their strategy for the European election campaign, so we’re likely to see more of this in coming weeks. They’ve found the perfect enemy.”The tension between France and Italy started before Macron, Salvini and Di Maio came to power. Italy resented French intervention in Libya, a former Italian colony. Italian pride was also hurt when the French snapped up €52.3 billion worth of Italian companies in the decade between 2006 and 2016, particularly during the 2008 economic crisis. There has been further resentment over Mr Macron’s resistance to the sale of a French STX shipyard to the Italian company . In Moscow for the World Cup final last summer, Mr Salvini announced he was rooting for . The French team had so many Africans that it wasn’t really French, he explained. “I heard the same thing from ordinary Italians,” Ms Maurel recalls. “Salvini and Di Maio have touched a chord. One senses love, fascination, rivalry and perhaps some jealousy on the part of Italian people.”Mr Macron and the previous Italian prime minister, , had envisioned a “Treaty of the Quirinale”, similar to  this week. The annual Franco-Italian summit did not take place last year, and the treaty is on hold. So is the plan for a high-speed train between  and Turin.Italy also backtracked on an agreement to lend the Louvre paintings by Leonardo da Vinci for an exhibition marking the 500th anniversary of the death of the Renaissance genius. Leonardo spent the last four years of his life in France, under the protection of King François I. “Leonardo was Italian,” Italy’s culture minister, , a member of Mr Salvini’s party, insisted when she cancelled the loan. Sending the paintings to Paris would threaten Italy’s national interests, she said. Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

Photograph: Emmanuel Foudrot/AFP/Getty ImagesWhile weekly protests by  and President Emmanuel Macron’s “great national debate” continue, the minds of French politicians turn increasingly to European parliamentary elections, only four months away.After 45 minutes of a dull exposé on the restructuring of Macron’s party, , its leader, , finally got round to the European contest at his first press conference of 2019 on Thursday.LREM’s main rival will be Marine Le Pen’s far right  (RN), which won the previous elections under its former name, Front National. In mid-January, LREM overtook RN in terms of voter intentions.Guerini alluded to “outside pressures” exerted by Le Pen’s foreign allies, including Donald Trump’s former adviser, , and Russian president . “People sometimes say we overdramatise what is at stake,” Guerini said. “But this is historic. The day after the election will either be the first day of the unravelling of the EU or the beginning of its reconstuction.”RN “are the party of lies and imposture”, Guerini said. “We saw it regarding the Marrakesh Pact and the Treaty of Aachen. Their European campaign will be dominated by fake news.”The French far left and far right falsely claimed that a UN pact on the rights of migrants would open  to unlimited immigration, and that the Franco-German treaty signed on Tuesday means France will give Alsace, Lorraine and its seat on the UN Security Council to Germany.“ has injected a slow poison into the veins of French democracy,” Guerini continued. “Day after day, she lies shamelessly. The texts are available, but she says they mean exactly the opposite of what they do.”LREM will create a “riposte cell” to denounce disinformation, which is now called “infox” in France. It will hold weekly briefings.Guerini accused MEPs from the RN of saying one thing about migration and taxation, then voting the other way in the EU parliament. “Marine Le Pen flaunts her friendship with [the Italian far right leader] . He wants France to take more migrants, which is the opposite of Marine Le Pen’s position.”Guerini said repeatedly that LREM would be “on the offensive”. Yet he refused to call on the party’s 410,000 members to participate in a pro-Macron “republican march for liberties” that is being organised for the Place de la République in Paris at 2pm on Sunday, January 27th. As a result, the march is almost certain to flop. The government too has refused to endorse it.“Stop the Violence” and , the groups organising the march, originally intended to call it “the republican march in support of Emmanuel Macron”. They dreamed of rallying a million people, like the May 30th, 1968 demonstration that ended the 1968 revolution.“I have not called on  [as members of LREM are called] to participate in the demonstration, even if I respect its intentions and its indignation over the violence at the Arc de Triomphe, against police and government buildings,” Guerini said, in reference to the  (yellow vests) protests. “But it seems to me it is not the role of LREM to demonstrate when we are in a phase of dialogue, when the national debate is taking hold. I did not want LREM to support one camp against another.”The  have announced they will field a list in the May election, led by , a 31-year-old care-giver who has appeared widely in French media during the crisis caused by the protests. Analysts say  participation will help Macron’s party, since the protesters are likely to siphon votes from the far right and far left. Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

Photograph: Guillaume Souvant/AFPPresident  on Monday night broke his silence over rioting that has plunged his presidency into its greatest crisis, promising a “new contract for the nation”.The French leader announced immediate measures to increase purchasing power, including a €100 rise in the minimum monthly wage, the cancellation of the increase in the general social contribution for pensioners earning less than €2,000 monthly, and an end to taxes and social charges on overtime from next year.Mr Macron also asked “all employers who can do so” to give employees a year-end bonus that will also be exempt from tax and social charges.A solemn Mr Macron spoke to camera, seated, with his hand flat on the table in front of him. He came across as chastened yet determined and looked younger than usual.The French leader began the most awaited speech of his presidency by denouncing the violence surrounding demonstrations by the “gilets jaunes” or yellow vest movement on December 1st and 8th.Four people have been killed, hundreds injured and more than 4,500 people arrested since the protests started. They were initially over a carbon tax on diesel and petrol. Prime minister  announced on December 5th that the tax was “suspended”. That was later changed to “cancelled”.“The events of recent weeks . . . have profoundly troubled the nation,” Mr Macron said. “They mixed legitimate demands with an inadmissible cycle of violence . . .”Many of those arrested in connection with the violence have received suspended prison sentences only.Mr Macron also denounced the political parties who have in a sense freeloaded on the misery of France’s poorest citizens. All parties except the president’s République en Marche have declared “solidarity” with the yellow vests. “We have seen the game of opportunist and irresponsible politicians whose sole goal was to shake the republic,” he said.Most participants in yellow vest demonstrations say they identify with no party, or with extreme-right or extreme-left-wing factions.As if on cue, the far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon reacted to Mr Macron’s speech saying that “the president’s words are vain. Act five [of the protests] next Saturday will be a moment of great mobilisation.”Marine Le Pen’s , the former , portrayed the conflict as part of the rise of nationalist populist movements across  and around the world. “In his speech, Mr Macron showed he has not understood a movement that must be analysed as a revolt against savage globalisation, against the global caste that enslaves people, against looting by great financial powers,” said a statement from the party.After rejecting the violence surrounding the protests, Mr Macron expressed understanding of the anger of the yellow vests. “This indignation, many French people may share it,” he said. “I do not want to reduce it to the irresponsible behaviour I just denounced . . . This anger is more profound. It may be our chance.”The president spoke of single mothers, pensioners and workers who are occupying traffic roundabouts. “Their distress didn’t start yesterday, but we had grown accustomed to it,” he admitted.  “Forty years of malaise are bubbling up.”The third part of his speech was Mr Macron’s . “Doubtless we have not provided a strong and rapid response in the last year and a half. I assume my share of responsibility.”Alluding to the half-dozen sarcastic comments that earned him a reputation for arrogance, Mr Macron said, “I know that I have hurt some of you by my statements.”Declaring “a state of economic and social emergency”, he outlined his measures.The president promised to fight tax evasion and to ensure that the heads of large French companies pay income tax in . However, he refused to cede ground on the wealth tax on capital investments, whose re-establishment has been a key demand of the yellow vests. During the 40 years the tax was in force, the rich left the country, he said.“We will not return to our usual lives as if nothing has changed,” Mr Macron promised. “We are at a historic juncture for our country. My only concern is you. My only battle is for you . . . for France.” Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

Photograph:  Michel Euler/EPAFrench president  has called on the nation to unite, stop “hateful” attacks during protests and avoid falling for “false information” online amid anti-government demonstrations that have sometimes turned violent.Mr Macron – whose approval ratings have plummeted in 2018 as he failed to shake the label “president of the rich” and faced an unprecedented citizens’ protest movement – went on the offensive in his televised new year’s speech.He deliberately did not name the  (yellow vests) movement that has been demonstrating against the government at road blockades and weekly city centre protests for six weeks. But he criticised what he called a minority who, he said, claimed to be the voice of the people but were in fact “megaphones of a hateful crowd who have lashed out at elected politicians, security forces, journalists, Jews, foreigners, homosexuals”.Mr Macron said this hatefulness was “the negation of France” and that “our future depends on our capacity to love each other and to love our nation”. He said he had “seen the unthinkable and heard the unacceptable” in recent weeks and that “order” in  would be maintained.Mr Macron spoke as more than 147,000 security forces were mobilised across the country for new year’s celebrations, not just because of the terrorist threat in France but also because authorities feared surprise demonstrations by anti-government protesters.Over the past decade, hundreds of cars have been set alight on the edge of French cities including  and  on New Year’s Eve in what has become a kind of end-of-year ritual. But officials said security services were on the alert for unannounced anti-government protests in order to prevent violence.The  movement, named after protesters’ hi-vis vests, began in November as a tax revolt against a new fuel duty. It has morphed into a nationwide protest against what has been seen as an unfair and unjust tax policy, and Mr Macron’s measures favouring businesses and the wealthy. Rioting, arson and running battles with police have occurred on the edge of demonstrations in Paris and other cities.In his new year speech, Mr Macron acknowledged the anger that had spread across France and tried to empathise. But he said it had been brewing for a long time – implying he did not accept the blame but instead laid responsibility on decades of mass unemployment and what he has called years of political stagnation.Mr Macron tried to channel the positivity of the anger, saying it “showed us that we’re not resigned to anything, that our country wants to build a better future”.He was careful to use the words “us” and “we” to avoid appearing cut off from the public mood. After he was mocked for the staid style of a recent televised speech aimed at calming the protests, which was delivered seated at a desk in a gilded room, this time Mr Macron stood up in a more modern room in the Elysee Palace.After some in Mr Macron’s shrinking supporter base feared he would step back from his manifesto promise of structural reforms because of the unrest, the president went on the offensive, vowing to press on with his plans to overhaul the social welfare state and social protection in 2019, beginning with changes to unemployment benefits.He said of his changes so far, including loosening of labour laws: “The results can’t be immediate, and impatience – which I share – can’t justify any kind of giving up.” He repeated his argument that unbridled, lawless “ultra free-market” capitalism was at its end, suggesting he wanted to reinvent a new form of responsible globalisation in a  that “protects”. Subscribe.

Photograph: Gerard Julien/AFP/Getty Images“We are a group of 10, from various professions, and we have decided to contribute to the Great Debate,” says the introduction to a 10-page manifesto which this week joins thousands of others on , the internet platform established by president  in the hope of leading  out of crisis.On page 3 of the manifesto, the as-yet nameless group lists the consequences of nearly three months of revolt: 13 dead, 2,800 wounded, €5.5 billion in losses (according to the Banque de France) and attacks on toll booths, public buildings, 150 tax centres and 2,000 traffic radars.As demonstrations and rioting by  took hold last November, my neighbour  began meeting regularly with his friends to discuss their horror at what was unfolding. Their group includes men and women from academia, the private sector and the top echelons of the French civil service.“No one listens to the shopkeepers whose shops are looted,” Lemaire, a retired business executive and commercial court judge, told me. “If you want to go viral, you have to be vulgar, hateful and against something. If you are for something, if you are polite and make coherent arguments, nobody is interested. The minority who support Macron remain silent, so we’re expressing ourselves.”Lemaire accepts with a tinge of sarcasm that he and his friends “are the elite, undeniably”. This is not a good time to be the elite in France. The super rich decamped years ago to London and Brussels. People like the Lemaires worked hard and paid high taxes.“Now we are seen as responsible for all the ills of French society. But we’re ‘the people’ too. We are no more responsible than anyone else for this situation. But they claim we’re crooks who don’t pay taxes.”Lemaire is appalled by what he sees as the ignorance of  and their uncritical coverage by French media. The plumber-electrician who looks after his holiday home, for example, is “a good guy, who’s been successful. But he told us the most absurd thing, that [the far right-wing leader]  was paid to throw the second round of the presidential election . . . He doesn’t read anything. He doesn’t listen. He spends all his time on conspiracy websites.”It wasn’t fair to expect Macron to reverse France’s decline in 18 months, Lemaire says. He believes the French “lack understanding of the basic rules of economics”.The mayors from small towns who met with Macron in the first debate in Normandy on January 15th were hostile at first. After seven hours, they gave him a standing ovation. Similar performances have followed.“They call Macron arrogant because he is intelligent and knows all the answers,” says Lemaire, who has watched several of the debates. “Well, he has all the answers because he works hard and reads all the dossiers.”Lemaire cites an article  in which the political scientist  says Macron “feeds the resentment and sense of social injustice of those who do not succeed”. In such an egalitarian society, where all positions are open to everyone, Schnapper writes, “There are many disappointed and humiliated people”.A poll published on February 5th shows Macron has risen 11 points in opinion polls since the beginning of the year, to a 34 per cent approval rating, higher than before the crisis.The authors of the manifesto urge Macron to forge ahead with his reform of the unemployment and pension systems, the civil service and multiple, overlapping levels of government. “It’s always complicated,” Lemaire admits.“France allegedly has strict equality in everything. But it doesn’t exist. There’s always the appendix, the codicil, which means that so-and-so is an exception, that so-and-so ‘has a right to’ ... It’s incredible.”The national debate “has relieved pressure and injected a measure of reason into the situation”, Lemaire continues. But he remains pessimistic, because of France’s runaway debt, which stands at nearly 100 per cent of GDP, and costs €45 billion in annual interest. “Nobody gives a damn,” he says. “My grandchildren will be asked to pay it.”Macron has suspended his reforms until the debate closes on March 15th. “His survival will depend on what he proposes,” Lemaire predicts. “My fear is that nothing will happen, that the system will freeze up, whatever he proposes.”Has it been worth all the hours of meetings to draft their manifesto, I ask. “At least we’ll be able to say we tried to do something,” Lemaire replies. Subscribe.

Photograph: Benoit Tessier/Reuters Anti-Semitism is rising sharply across , experts have said, as  reported a 74 per cent increase in the number of offences against Jews last year and  said the number of violent anti-Semitic attacks had surged by more than 60 per cent.The figures confirm the results of three recent Europe-wide surveys showing Jewish people feel at greater risk, and are experiencing markedly more aggression, amid a generalised increase in racist hate speech and violence in a significantly coarser, more polarised political environment.France’s interior ministry said this week that recorded incidents of anti-Semitism rose to 541 last year from 311 in 2017, while the German government said offences motivated by hatred of Jews hit a 10-year high of 1,646 in 2018. Physical attacks rose from 37 to 62, leaving 43 people needing medical treatment.The French president, , denounced the trend as “unacceptable”, telling ministers that anti-Semitism in France was “a repudiation of the Republic and its values”. Petra Pau, an MP for Germany’s Die Linke party, said more and more people felt free to “deny the Holocaust and engage in anti-Semitic agitation”.In the largest ever survey of Jewish anti-Semitism opinion, addressing more than 16,000 Jewish people in 12 European countries, the EU’s Fundamental Rights Agency said at the end of last year that anti-Semitic hate speech, harassment and an increasing fear of being recognised as Jewish were becoming the new normal.“Decades after the Holocaust, shocking and mounting levels of anti-Semitism continue to plague the EU,” the FRA director, Michael O’Flaherty, said. “Jewish people have a right to live freely, without hate and without fear for their safety.”The report found 90 per cent of respondents felt anti-Semitism was growing in their country and 30 per cent had been harassed. Over a third avoided going to Jewish events or sites because of safety fears, while the same proportion had considered emigrating. Nearly 80 per cent no longer reported minor incidents because they thought “nothing would change”.A 28-nation EU Eurobarometer poll released last month revealed a widening gulf between public perceptions of anti-Semitism and those of the Jewish community: while 89 per cent of Jewish people polled said anti-Semitism had “significantly increased” over the past five years, only 36 per cent of the general public felt it had.Another major recent survey of public attitudes for CNN found more than a fifth of the 7,000 people polled in seven countries believed Jewish people have too much influence in finance and politics, while 34 per cent felt they knew little or nothing about the Holocaust - even if 32 per cent still thought Jews exploited it to “advance their position”.A combination of factors seem to be to blame. In the past two decades, anti-Semitic attacks in Europe have generally peaked in line with tensions in the Middle East. “They were essentially the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, imported,” said Marc Knobel, a historian at the Crif umbrella group for France’s Jewish organisations. “Rather than attacking Israelis, people went for Jews.”But since early last year, said Frederic Potier of the French government’s anti-racism and anti-Semitism body Dilcrah, more traditional forms of anti-Semitism have re-emerged. “We are witnessing the resurgence of a virulent, far-right identity politics that does not hesitate to put its beliefs into action,” Potier told Le Monde.Knobel said the taboos around anti-Semitism “had all but disappeared”, pointing to the re-emergence of longstanding anti-Semitic tropes involving Jews and money. In France, for example, he told Liberation, the fact that Macron previously worked for the  merchant bank had “fuelled a load of rumours”.Experts describe a “perfect storm” for anti-Semitic attacks combining the increasing influence of far-right groups and governments; the rise of conspiracy theories about a supposed global Zionist plot (and the scale on which they circulate on social media); and a general increase in the violence of public discourse.Although the most recent rise in anti-Semitic incidents in France began before the emergence of the anti-establishment gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement, some have occurred during their weekly Saturday demonstrations. A recent poll suggested nearly half of yellow vest protesters believed in a “Zionist plot”.Alternative fur Deutschland’s (AfD) Alexander Gauland described the Holocaust as a “small bird dropping in over 1,000 years of successful German history”. AfD party has been widely accused of fomenting hate against refugees, Muslims and Jews.A large influx of mostly Muslim refugees and migrants to Germany from 2015 has also led to a rise in anti-Semitic attacks by migrants from Arab states, although figures show an overwhelming majority of violence against Jews is perpetrated by far-right supporters. “Militant rightwing extremists are now openly calling for the desecration of Jewish institutions and attacks against Jewish people,” Pau said.Some governments, particularly in eastern Europe, stand accused of at best tolerating racism and anti-Semitism, and at worst encouraging it. Hungary’s far-right Fidesz party, led by prime minister Viktor Orban, has run vitriolic campaigns against migrants and demonising George Soros, the Hungarian-born Jewish financier.In CNN’s recent survey, 42 per cent of Hungarians polled said they thought Jews held too much sway over the worlds of finance and international affairs. While an average of one in 10 Europeans said they personally had an “unfavourable attitude” to Jews, the figure rose to nearly 15 per cent in  and 19 per cent in . The European council late last year adopted a declaration urging all EU members to increase their efforts to “prevent and combat all forms of anti-Semitism”, as well as “assure the security of Jewish communities, institutions and citizens”.But the bloc’s Fundamental Rights Agency said a “wave” of anti-Jewish hate crime was threatening “the very values on which the union was built”.After swastikas were daubed this week on portraits on Paris postboxes of Simone Veil, the late French Holocaust survivor and politician, Jean Veil, her son, told RTL radio that “at bottom, we knew the leprosy was still there”.–Guardian  Subscribe.

The New York Times were on the ground in Paris with the “Yellow Vests” protesters as they took to the streets for the fourth week in a row. Video: NYTProtesters wearing Pikachu hats take part in a Women’s Gilets Jaunes protest in front of the Eiffel Tower on January 20th. Photograph: Ian Langsdon/EPAThough it started as a protest over fuel taxes, the still simmering  revolt in  quickly morphed into anger over income inequality and social injustice.Yet paradoxically, the French government is one of the world’s leading redistributors of wealth and social injustice is less than in other developed countries. magazine and  newspaper have in recent days published in-depth dossiers on the question. They cited studies by the French statistical institute  and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which found that income inequality is relatively low in France. And there is less poverty in France than elsewhere in the EU.Economists measure income inequality by the Gini coefficient, where zero would mean complete equality. France’s Gini coefficient of 0.289 compares favourably with inequality in the UK (0.351) and the US (0.391). Contrary to popular perception, inequality is not increasing, but stagnating, in France. And it is dramatically lower than 50 to 100 years ago.Likewise, statistics show that purchasing power too has stagnated, not decreased, over the past decade, except for brief periods in 2012 and 2013. However, Insee admits, the cost of basic necessities has risen, especially for the poorest, which sometimes gives the impression the statistics are lying.Only the wealthiest 43.14 per cent of French households pay income tax, and France has the highest rate of payroll deductions in the world. Yet “make the rich pay” is a constant cry of the ’.Insee reported in October that the richest 10 per cent of the French paid 70 per cent of all income tax collected in 2017, or €55 billion out of €78 billion.Before income redistribution, the average income of the 20 per cent of wealthiest households was 8.4 times the average income of the poorest 20 per cent.After redistribution, the richest were only 3.9 times better off than the poorest, Insee reported. Government payments, including housing subsidies and social welfare, accounted for two-thirds of the reduction in inequality, while income tax accounted for the other third.However, the  French are less socially mobile and less equal in opportunity than citizens of other developed countries. It takes six generations for the offspring of a poor French family to reach median income, compared to four to five generations in other OECD countries.  In 2017, France ranked eighth among 28 EU countries, with 14 per cent of the population, or 8.8 million people, living in poverty, according to a chart published by .  ranked 11th, with 15.6 per cent in poverty, while  was 15th, with 16.1 per cent, and the UK was 17th, with 17 per cent.The French far right and far left claim that ordinary French people are victims of “ultra liberal” government policies that have led the state to disengage from the economy.In fact,  reports, “The weight of the state has never been greater in the economic life of the country.” Over the past 30 years, public spending has tripled, from the equivalent of €416 billion in 1987 to €1,294 billion in 2017. As a percentage of GDP, government spending has risen from 50 to 57 per cent of GDP, the highest in the OECD and, according to some sources, the highest in the world.Social protection has risen from 24.5 per cent of French GDP in 1959 to 32 per cent – also the highest in the OECD – in 2016. Between 1980 and 2017, the number of civil servants rose from 3.86 million to 5.66 million.When President  addressed his compatriots in a letter announcing a national debate earlier this month, he said, “France is not like other countries. The sense of injustice is more intense than elsewhere. The demand for mutual assistance and solidarity is greater.”One can only speculate why a generous welfare state has engendered the most persistent anti-government protests in . The different attitude cited by Macron, coupled with a revolutionary tradition, has something to do with it. Fears that Macron’s reforms would alter the system also played a part. As the 19th century philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville observed, the most dangerous moment for a government is usually when it begins to reform. Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

The clean-up operation continued along what France calls the “most beautiful avenue in the world”, as city authorities mobilised 200 extra workers to repair the extensive damage to streets and buildings.Shopkeepers whose windows were smashed and tagged with graffiti during what was supposed to be a peaceful demonstration by the (yellow vests) had been hoping for a busy weekend after the Champs-Élysées’ celebrated Christmas lights were turned on last week.Instead they were forced to shut their shops as the street turned into a battlefield when a small number of protesters built barricades between themselves and the police and set fire to them.“We shouldn’t underestimate the impact of these images of the Champs-Élysées ... with battle scenes that were broadcast by the media in France and abroad,” government spokesman  told a news briefing, recounting Mr Macron’s words. “Behind this anger there is obviously something deeper and which we must answer, because this anger, these anxieties have existed for a long time,” Mr Griveaux said.BFM TV reported that France’s intelligence services had identified 80-120 extreme-right sympathisers at the heart of the violence, while other media claimed tags and logos at the scene suggested extreme left-wing and anarchist organisations were involved.Officials said it was too early to establish the cost of the damage, but one estimated it could be up to €1.5 million.Although sparked by fuel price rises, the movement has embraced wider dissatisfaction with Mr Macron and his centrist government, who are seen as out of touch with ordinary people. Ministers have said there will be no U-turn on fuel tax increases, which are part of environmental measures. Mr Macron is expected to respond to the protests in a speech on Tuesday.Paris police chief Michel Delpuech said forces had used 5,000 tear-gas canisters – “more than one a minute, which has never been seen before” – while fire services put out about 100 fires. Police arrested 103 people, including a handful of minors; 45 have been charged and are due to appear before a judge.Thirty-one people were injured in the clashes – 24 protesters and seven police officers. One protester was accused of throwing metal nuts at police, leaving one at risk of losing an eye, and was due in court on Monday along with a prison guard reportedly carrying a hammer when he was arrested at the protests.The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, blamed “seditious” and “ultra-right” hooligans for hijacking the  protest and sparking violence, but police said those arrested were mostly young men with no criminal record, many of them from outside Paris.“We are well aware that it’s a very small minority who for several years have attached themselves to protests each time in order to smash everything up,” said Emmanuel Gregoire, Paris deputy mayor.Officials said more than 106,000 protested across France on Saturday, about half the number in demonstrations the previous week, in which two died.

File photograph: Claudio Peri/EPAFrench ambassador to Italy Christian Masset has been recalled. File photograph: Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty ImagesItalian interior minister Matteo Salvini  next to its minister of labour Luigi Di Maio at the Quirinal palace in Rome. File photograph: Tony Gentile/Reuters recalled its ambassador to Rome on Thursday, for the first time since  declared war on France in 1940. The move signifies a serious rupture, unprecedented in postwar relations between European powers and only a step short of breaking diplomatic ties.Agnès Von Der Mühll, the spokeswoman for the French foreign ministry, announced the recall of ambassador  in a short statement.“France has for several months been the object of repeated accusations, of baseless attacks, of outrageous declarations that everyone knows and bears in mind,” Ms Von Der Muhll said. In a remark so vulgar that it was little reported in France, the Italian undersecretary for foreign affairs, , recently said French president  “suffers from the syndrome of the small penis”.Mr Di Stefano is part of the populist  (M5S) whose leader, , is a deputy prime minister and minister for labour., the head of the far right League, interior minister and the strongman in the Italian government, said recently that he felt sorry for “millions of men and women in France who live with a very bad government and a very bad president of the republic”.For high-ranking officials from a founding member of the EU to support calls for the resignation of the president of a fellow founding member is also unprecedented.Mr Salvini attempted to ease tensions after the ambassador’s recall on Thursday. He told the : “I am ready to turn the page in our relations with France, for the good of our people and I would be happy to meet Macron. But France must stop turning back migrants at the border.”On Tuesday, Mr Di Maio met representatives of the rebellious “yellow vests” movement in the French town of Montargis. He had urged them to “hang in there” last month.Mr Di Maio posted a photograph of himself with  leaders on Instagram, with the caption, “The winds of change have crossed the Alps. I repeat: the winds of change have crossed the Alps.”Mr Di Maio called the photograph “a souvenir of a beautiful meeting, the first of a series, during which we talked about our countries, social rights, the environment and direct democracy”.Christophe Chalençon, a  leader who met Mr Di Maio, and who is launching a list for the May 26th European election, said he wanted “to clarify the relations between  and the League” because it was “out of the question for us to draw closer to the extreme right”. Mr Chalençon was satisfied that M5S was “a popular, centre left-wing movement”.The meeting “gave international value to our action,” Mr Chalençon continued. Mr Di Maio has invited the French protesters to Rome.Mr Salvini and Mr Di Maio both seek potential allies in the EU parliament. It was inadmissible that discord between the two countries “be exploited for electoral reasons”, the French foreign ministry said. Alluding to Mr Di Maio’s trip to Montargis, it added: “The most recent interference constitutes an additional and unacceptable provocation. It violates the respect that is due to democratic choices, made by a friendly, allied country. It violates the respect that democratically and freely elected governments owe to each other. The European election campaign cannot justify the absence of respect for other peoples or their democracy. ”The situation has worsened dramatically since Mr Salvini and Mr Di Maio came to power last June, but the deterioration in Franco-Italian relations started eight years ago, with the French intervention in Libya, and was aggravated by France’s response to migrants landing on Italian beaches. Subscribe.

Photograph: Stephane Mahe/ReutersPolice fired stun grenades, tear gas and water cannon in battles with “yellow vest” protesters in Paris, in a third weekend of nationwide unrest against high living costs.In Paris, police said they had arrested almost 300 people while almost 100 were injured as protesters hurled projectiles at riot officers, burned cars and smashed shop fronts. In some areas, groups of masked men roamed freely, smashing a police van with metal bars and setting trees alight.Police fired stun grenades, tear gas and water cannon at protesters at the top of the Champs-Élysées boulevard and multiple sites across the city including Opera and Place de la Bastille. More than a dozen metro stations were closed.“We are in a state of insurrection, I’ve never seen anything like it,” Jeanne d’Hauteserre, the mayor of the 8th city district, near the Arc de Triomphe, told BFM TV.The popular rebellion erupted out of nowhere on November 17th and spread quickly via social media, with protesters blocking roads across  and impeding access to shopping malls, factories and some fuel depots.On Saturday, some targeted the Arc de Triomphe, chanting “Macron resign” and scrawling on the facade of the towering 19th-century arch: “The yellow vests will triumph.”Prime minister Édouard Philippe expressed his disappointment: “I am shocked by the attacks on the symbols of France. We are committed to dialogue, but also respect for the law.”Other protesters smashed the windows of shops including branches of Chanel, Apple Inc and Dior, where protesters daubed a wooden board “Merry Mayhem”.Security officials were locked inside the interior ministry for crisis talks for several hours during the afternoon.The skirmishes in Paris broke out early on Saturday, amid concern that violent far-right and far-left groups were infiltrating the “gilets jaunes” (yellow vests) movement.Police were tracking “violent radical groups” who were well-prepared and switching from one location to another, deputy interior minister Laurent Nunez said.The “yellow vest” protests began as a backlash against president Emmanuel Macron’s fuel tax hikes, but have tapped into a vein of deep dissatisfaction felt towards the 40-year-old’s economic reforms, which many voters feel favour the wealthy and big business.Unrest erupted in several towns and cities across France, from Charleville-Mézières in the northeast to Marseilles in the south. In the Riviera city of Nice, trucks blocked access to the airport.The protests are taking a toll on the economy. Numerous neighbourhoods in central Paris that would have been teeming with tourists and Christmas shoppers instead resembled battle zones, as smoke and tear gas hung in the air and debris littered the ground.Hotels and department stores in Paris stand to lose millions in revenue, and shelves have run empty in some supermarket stores in the country.The protests have caught Mr Macron off-guard just as he was trying to counter a fall in his popularity rating to 20 per cent. His unyielding response has exposed him to charges of being out of touch with ordinary people, particularly in rural villages and the provincial hinterlands.Some peaceful protesters held up a slogan reading, “Macron, stop treating us like idiots!”Mr Macron, who is at the G20 leaders summit in Argentina, on Tuesday said he understood the anger of voters outside France’s big cities over the squeeze fuel prices have put on households. But he insisted he would not be bounced into changing policy by “thugs”.Despite the unrest that has accompanied the protests, the “yellow vests” have widespread public support, even in the cities.“I am totally behind the ‘gilets jaunes’,” said George DuPont, a resident in Paris’ upscale 16th arrondissement. “The state has stolen money from the French people. It’s time too give it back.”Assistant teacher Sandrine Lemoussu (45) who travelled from Burgundy to protest peacefully, said people were fed up with Mr Macron.“The people are in revolt,” she said. “The anger is rising more and more, and the president despises the French. We aren’t here to smash things, but the people have had enough.”Many on the outskirts of smaller provincial towns and villages have expressed anger, underlining the gap between metropolitan elites and working class voters that has boosted anti-establishment politics across the western world.“Mr Macron wrote a book called Revolution. He was prophetic because it is what he has managed to launch, but not the revolution he sought,” left-wing La France Insoumise leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon told reporters ahead of a protest in Marseilles.The yellow vests get their name from the high-visibility jackets all motorists in France must carry in their vehicles. – Reuters Subscribe.

Green municipal vans with power hoses began a three-day clean-up at the Arc de Triomphe. “The yellow vests will triumph,” graffiti said. “The state. The cops. The fascists,” said the message scrawled under a Circle-A, the symbol of anarchists.Paris’s triumphal avenues looked like a battlefield on Sunday, following the worst riots in the centre of the capital since the May 1968 revolution. Near the Irish embassy on the avenue Foch, rioters built barricades from tree trunks. In the boulevard Haussmann, they tore municipal bicycles from their stands for the same purpose.The Printemps and Galeries Lafayette, temples of luxury and consumerism, had to be evacuated. In the Tuileries gardens, last destroyed in the 1870 Commune, a protester was seriously injured when a wrought iron fence dug up by the yellow vests fell on him.Three people have died in three weeks of protests. Another 133 were wounded on Saturday, including a woman struck in the head by a projectile at Charleville-Mézières. Rioters twice over-ran the landing strip at Nantes airport. They stole an assault rifle from a police van in Paris, commandeered a digging machine from a building site near the Arc de Triomphe, set fire to a prefecture in upper Loire and threw acid at police in Tours.President  was the main focus of their hatred. “Macron will pay for Christmas,” “Macron, son of a bitch,” and “Banker thieves. Government crooks. Revolution” were daubed on the walls of Paris’s grand avenues.On his return from the  summit in Argentina on Sunday, Macron inspected the Arc de Triomphe and surrounding avenues. A group gathered round him, jeering, “Macron, resignation”. While police clamoured for Macron to declare a state of emergency, the Élysée announced that the president “would not express himself” right away.Traffic clogged as motorists slowed to view the destruction. Tourists snapped photographs of broken glass and charred vehicles. At the same time, dozens queued to buy luxury handbags at Louis Vuitton. Was it revolution, or just a dangerous game of pretend?Most of the 412 people detained on Saturday were ordinary citizens who support the yellow vests. The real culprits, the  or vandals who played cat-and-mouse with police firing tear gas, ran fast enough to evade arrest.The first marches mobilised 280,000 protesters of nearly all political stripes three weeks ago. Now, an increasing number express support for Marine Le Pen’s far right . Anger over high taxes on fuel transformed into broader resentment over falling living standards, neglect of the countryside and Macron’s perceived aloofness.The proportion of  has increased, as the number of protesters dwindled to 136,000 countrywide on Saturday. Interior minister  has accused the far right of responsibility for the violence. Le Pen said it was the fault of “extreme left-wing factions”.It was impossible to fight such an unstructured movement, police said. “The forces of order cannot organise in advance,” said Philippe Capon of the Unsa police syndicate. “There’s no pre-determined protest route, no organisers to talk to. The yellow vests have been submerged by the .”In one of the most telling scenes of the riots, 20 yellow vests sat in a circle, like Indians around a campfire, to protect the flame to the Unknown Soldier from the . Members of the public are distinguishing between the yellow vests and the vandals. Opinion polls show 80 per cent of the population are supporting the former.“The yellow vests defend everybody’s interests,” said the taxi driver who took me on a tour of the destruction. “Since they started their protests, the price of diesel has fallen dramatically… But I didn’t sign up for the . I know people who lost their cars yesterday, or had their shops damaged.”Glorification of France’s “revolutionary spirit” helps to explain the riots. Marianne, the country’s symbol, whose bust stands in every town hall, wears the Phrygian cap of revolution. The frieze on the side of the Arc de Triomphe, desecrated this weekend, shows Liberty Leading the People.The handful of self-proclaimed spokespersons who have emerged to speak for the yellow vests appear to have been shocked by the violence. They published an appeal in the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday. “We are offering the government an exit from the crisis,” they said. “Democracy belongs to the people.”Taxation, which comprises 48.3 per cent of French GDP, the highest percentage in the EU, is a major grievance.The yellow vests’ first demand was the creation of an “estates general on fiscal policy”. The “estates general” was a consultative body, resurrected by Louis XVI from May until July 1789 in the hope of defusing unrest. That experiment ended in full-blown revolution, regicide and the Terror. Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

Photograph:  AFP/Getty ImagesThe French government said on Tuesday it would suspend planned fuel tax increases for six months, in response to violent protests against the measures by the so-called  movement, prime minister, announced the moratorium on the increase in the fuel tax scheduled for January 1st, in an attempt to ease the “yellow vests” protest, after meeting MPs from the governing party.“These decisions must ease tensions and bring back serenity to the country,” Mr Philippe said in a televised address.The move marks the first time in Emmanuel Macron’s 18-month presidency that he has backed down on measures in the face of street protests, and comes as he faces record low approval ratings.The government had planned to raise taxes on petrol and diesel by 2.9 cents and 6.5 cents a litre, respectively, from January, partly to curb rising carbon emissions. But the proposed policy has provoked weeks of increasingly violent protests across the country by gilets jaunes – named after the fluorescent security vests car drivers have to keep in their vehicles.The demonstrations, which began as an online protest, have morphed into a wide-ranging revolt against stagnating wages, a drop in people’s purchasing power, and against Mr Macron himself. The fuel tax increase would have disproportionately affected those on low incomes and rural populations reliant on cars, and some felt it was the last straw by a president whose policies are perceived to favour the rich.Earlier on Tuesday morning Stanislas Guerini, who on Saturday was elected the new leader of Mr Macron’s La République en Marche, said he was in favour of a moratorium on raising fuel taxes.“Yes, I think it would be healthy, I think we must appease the country,” he said on RTL radio.About 136,000 demonstrators were recorded across  on Saturday, and violence escalated in the French capital, where at least 263 people were injured and 412 arrested. In the wealthy west and centre of Paris, stores were smashed and looted, barricades erected, and the Arc de Triomphe covered in graffiti.While the majority of the demonstrators were peaceful, the protests were infiltrated by both the far-left and the far-right, alongside wreckers, or .The violence has so far not undermined the movement’s strong public backing. An opinion poll by Harris Interactive, taken after Saturday’s protests, suggested the have an approval rating of about 72 per cent, the same as before the clashes.A freeze of planned fuel tax increases was one of a number of measures called for in an editorial by 10 self-proclaimed gilets jaunes representatives published on Sunday in the weekly newspaper . They also demanded the holding of countrywide consultations over taxes.Christophe Castaner, interior minister, said on Sunday that measures under consideration by the government include the imposition of a state of emergency and the deployment of soldiers to help contain the next protests, which are scheduled for Saturday.On Monday Mr Philippe held separate meetings with opposition party leaders, in which they demanded the scrapping of the planned increase in fuel taxes. The same day striking students closed down 100 high schools and rising fuel shortages were reported in some parts of the country. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018 Subscribe.

He left it to prime minister  to announce measures including a six-month suspension of price hikes on petrol and diesel.But initial reaction from the gilets jaunes, or yellow vests, the movement behind anti-government protests across the country, indicated the policy reversal might be too little too late.Philippe began by acknowledging the long-simmering anger of much of the French population. “One would have to be deaf and blind not to see it, not to hear it,” he said.On December 1st, the third march in as many weeks descended into rioting that ravaged much of central Paris. Four people have died in the protests.In line with traditional French indulgence towards political violence, Philippe said the anger was that of “hard-working , which has a hard time making ends meet, of French people who have their back against the wall, of mothers raising children alone. This anger has its source in a profound injustice. That of not being able to live decently from the fruit of one’s labour”.The long-ignored yellow vests had suddenly become “French people who love their country”, who “want taxes to go down and work to pay”.That was also the government’s goal, Philippe said. “If I did not succeed in expressing that, if the majority found it difficult to convince the French, we must change something.”The government has enacted measures for the disadvantaged, including lowering the habitation tax and social charges, and a scheduled 3 per cent rise in the minimum wage, Philippe noted. But those measures have remained invisible and inaudible to a large segment of the population who view Macron as the “president of the rich”.A year ago, Macron staged a “One Planet Summit” in Paris. In line with France’s commitment to reduce greenhouse emissions, he programmed a 2.9 cents per litre rise in the price of petrol, and a 6.5 cents per litre rise for diesel from January 1st.Now, to the chagrin of environmentalists, the carbon tax will be “suspended” for six months. Philippe’s promise that the taxes “will not be applied before being debated by all parties involved” implied they may never happen.The government also renounced aligning prices for petrol and diesel. For years, the buyers of diesel vehicles were given bonuses, in the mistaken belief that it was less polluting.The government is suspending more thorough motor vehicle tests, another grievance of the yellow vests. A scheduled rise in home heating costs has also been suspended. Commuters will be given a “mobility bonus”. The government will invest more in housing, and “open a broad debate on taxes and public spending”.Measures promised by Philippe will cost the state at least €2 billion.But will it be enough? Yellow vest supporters said it might have been, earlier, but they were too angry to turn back now. Many demand restoration of the pre-Macron wealth tax.“They’ve already tricked us by claiming to hear us, then ignoring us completely,” was a typical reaction on the France Info website.“Suspending doesn’t mean cancelling,” wrote another. “The government must expect a hardening of the movement.”Macron on Tuesday visited the prefecture that was burned by rioters at Puy-en-Velay, upper Loire, to express support for civil servants there. About 20 demonstrators gathered outside and jeered him with cries of “Macron resign” on his departure. Protesters pursued his motorcade until bodyguards got out to confront them.Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the May ’68 revolutionary, former MEP and a friend of Macron, told France Inter radio that the president “must question himself. He has the ability and the agility to do so. He must fundamentally question his practice of power”.The measures announced by Philippe would not be enough, Cohn-Bendit predicted. “Now the president has to say where he is going, where we must go. He has to put everything on the table” including partial abrogation of the wealth tax.Macron is paying for his lack of political experience, Cohn-Bendit said. “You can’t always be first in the class. You have to say, ‘Maybe, even if I was right, if it doesn’t work you have to replace it.’ You have to find a solution to calm people in the face of inequality.”France waits to see what will happen on Saturday, when the yellow vests have called for a fourth nationwide demonstration. Philippe said the marches “must be declared [in advance] and must take place peacefully”.At the request of the Paris prefecture, a football match between Paris St Germain and Montpellier, a televised benefit for rare diseases and the annual “Animals’ Christmas,” all scheduled for Saturday, have been cancelled.Speaking before the Senate later in the day, interior minister  appealed to “reasonable yellow vests not to gather in Paris on Saturday”. Subscribe.

Photograph: Reuters  French president Emmanuel Macron will describe  as a wake-up call in a speech this month when he will say Europe must be more assertive in the face of rival world powers, according to sources close to the Élysée Palace.His words are intended as a “warning shot” for a continent unable to project power and defend itself, say aides. They describe the speech as Mr Macron’s most important since he urged fundamental reform of the European Union in 2017.“This is a critical time,” said a source close to President Macron. “If we Europeans don’t want to have other Brexits and become trapped in a naive defence of status quo, we have to wake up.”Mr Macron’s speech coincides with rising tensions in the West, which has been shaken by US president Donald Trump’s “America First” policies and Britain’s departure from the EU. A more assertive China and Russia also pose significant challenges.Although the French president will use Brexit as the main impetus for his speech, the aim is not to offer an initiative to unblock the negotiating stalemate between London and Brussels, said the source.“He won’t comment on the negotiation, or offer some kind of ‘Macron plan’ to fix the problem. The idea is to draw the lessons from Brexit,” said the source.In Mr Macron’s view, Brexit is part of the same phenomenon that brought Trump to power and sparked the yellow-vest movement in France: a fear of losing out from globalisation, territorial inequalities and rising contempt for the establishment.The French president will focus on championing a “Europe that protects” in the May 26th European election. And he will try to convince voters with plans aimed at reforming Europe’s trade, competition, digital and climate policies.The speech will also seek to convince his European counterparts, who have watered down many of his 2017 proposals, to start thinking of the EU as a tougher geopolitical player in a ruthless world.“The EU has done the internal regulation rather well, built a nice, peaceful area, with benign trade and regulated competition. But Europe hasn’t understood how to carry itself in a brutal world,” said the source Meanwhile, Gibraltar’s leader has said an incursion into British waters by a Spanish warship at the weekend was a quixotic attempt at intimidation. But he said the people of Gibraltar would stand up to bullies before and after Brexit on March 29th.“Anyone who believes in the rules-based international legal order will have been shocked by the cavalier and quixotic actions of the Spanish military vessel at the weekend,” said Gibraltar chief minister Fabian Picardo.“This childish behaviour is unsatisfactory whether it is errant or directed from above,” said Mr Picardo. “The people of Gibraltar won’t be bullied now or after the 29th of March.”Mr Picardo said the Spanish vessel sailed through Gibraltar’s waters with her weapons uncovered. – Reuters Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Francois Guillot/AFP/Getty ImagesPolice in  have detained one of the leaders of the gilets jaunes anti-government movement for organising an unauthorised protest, as authorities adopt a tougher approach to try to curb demonstrations by the movement.The arrested man, , a lorry driver, already faces trial in June for “carrying a prohibited category-D weapon”, after he was allegedly found with a wooden stick at a previous protest.Since November 17th, the gilets jaunes – or “yellow vests”, named after their fluorescent jackets – have regularly held demonstrations that were not declared to the authorities. For several weekends, gilets jaunes demonstrations in Paris and other cities such as  and  saw violent skirmishes with police, as well as banks and shops smashed up and cars burned.Mr Drouet was arrested by police in Paris on Wednesday night as he was heading towards the Champs-Élysées, where several demonstrators had been waiting for him. They said they intended only to light candles for the people injured in demonstrations or killed in road accidents during the six weeks of protests, which took place on roads and roundabouts and began as a fuel-tax revolt but morphed into a movement against the president, , and policies seen to favour the rich.Mr Drouet’s lawyer called the arrest “totally unjustified and arbitrary”. He said Mr Drouet had intended to lay candles at Place de la Concorde in Paris and then meet others in a private place.France’s minister for the economy, Bruno Le Maire, defended Mr Drouet’s arrest, saying: “It’s called respecting the rule of law . . . It’s normal that when you break the laws of the republic, you face the consequences.”The authorities now appear to be clamping down on the continuing protests. The interior ministry wrote to local police chiefs this week saying that the rural and suburban roundabouts and toll booths which have been occupied for weeks should be cleared of protesters.Some said that the arrest of Mr Drouet, often seen on TV as a gilets jaunes spokesman, could turn him into a sort of martyr figure and harden the resolve of demonstrators.Following the arrest, the leftwing leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a fierce critic of Mr Macron, tweeted: “Again Eric Drouet arrested, why? Abuse of power. A politicised police targeting and harassing the leaders of the yellow vest movement.”, a gilets jaunes media figure who takes a more moderate line on the protests, said after Mr Drouet’s arrest: “Unfortunately I have the impression that the government wants to radicalise the movement. The executive is pouring oil on the fire. They’ve just put another coin in the jukebox and the gilets jaunes song is going to go on playing, that’s for sure.” – Guardian Subscribe.

It’s like living in an armed camp.When the protests started in November, shops and banks would put plywood sheets over their windows late on Friday, then remove them on Sunday.Now they leave the protective siding in place, giving central Paris the allure of a shanty town.On December 29th, turnout for the protests dwindled to 12,000 nationwide. Many heaved a sigh of relief in the mistaken belief that the  (yellow vest) movement had been defused by president Emmanuel Macron’s promise of €10 billion to increase purchasing power.But on January 5th, 50,000  came back with a vengeance.

A similar fund, set up for the 1,050 police who have been wounded in riots, raised far less.In the old  television show, the puppet version of former Trotskyist leader  promised in a soft voice to “string the bourgeois up by their entrails”.At three Christmas dinners I attended in Paris, I detected a frisson of fear in the French bourgeoisie, a premonition that we’d all be strung up.Virtually everyone I know likes Macron and detests the .

Thousands of protesters also marched noisily but peacefully through the Grands Boulevards shopping area in northern Paris. This is close to where a gas explosion in a bakery killed three people, including two firefighters, and injured nearly 50 early on Saturday.The centre city was in lockdown against another feared eruption of violence by radical elements in the gilets jaunes movement. Bridges across the Seine river closed and official buildings such as parliament and the Elysee presidential palace are protected by police barriers.Groups of protesters also gathered on and around Paris’s famous Champs Elysees boulevard, the scene of disturbances in recent weeks, many of them calling loudly for Mr Macron’s resignation.“Macron, we are going to tear down your place!” read one banner.Around the 19th-century Arc de Triomphe at the top of the Champs Elysee, riot police unleashed water cannon and tear gas at protesters after being pelted with stones and paint, said witnesses.By mid-afternoon there had been no major clashes with police unlike in previous weeks. In Paris more than 50 people were arrested, some for carrying objects that could be used as weapons.There were also thousands of marches in the cities of Bordeaux and Toulon in southern France as well as Strasbourg in the east and the central city of Bourges.Bourges authorities said nearly 5,000 gilets jaunes stuck to the designated demonstration area. But another 500 had pushed into the city centre that was off limits for demonstrators.Many businesses in Bourges had been boarded up up to avoid damage from protesters. And authorities had removed street furniture and building site materials that could be used for barricades.In Strasbourg, up to 2,000 demonstrators gathered in front of the European Parliament building and later marched to the centre of the city on the Rhine river border with Germany. Protesters set garbage bins ablaze and police fired tear gas grenades, but no serious violence or looting was reported.More than 80,000 police were on duty for the protests nationwide, including 5,000 in Paris.The gilets jaunes take their name from the high-visibility jackets they wear at road barricades and on the street. Their rage stems from a squeeze on household incomes and a belief that Mr Macron, a former investment banker regarded as close to big business, is indifferent to their hardships.Mr Macron, often criticised for a monarchical manner, is to launch a national debate on January 15th in an attempt to mollify the gilets jaunes, whose unrest has shaken his administration.The debate, to be held on the internet and in town halls, will focus on four themes: taxes, green energy, institutional reform and citizenship.

Photograph: Abdul Abeissa/AFP/GettyThe latest round of anti-government protests across  at the weekend degenerated in Paris into violent clashes between protesters and the security forces, prompting President  to condemn “extreme violence”.For the eighth Saturday in a row,  demonstrators – sporting the yellow reflective jackets that French motorists are obliged to carry in their cars – massed in cities around the country to protest against the cost of living and to call for Mr Macron’s resignation, underlining the challenge to the once-popular president’s authority after more than two months of disruption.The interior ministry said there were some 50,000 demonstrators nationwide, compared with 32,000 the previous Saturday during the Christmas-new year holiday period. There were also clashes in ,  and other cities.In recent days Mr Macron and his government, sensing that urban shopkeepers and residents are dismayed by the economic impact of the prolonged unrest, as well as by the burning of cars and smashing of shop windows, have decided to take a tough line against the demonstrators, and have suggested that those who continue to protest are extremists who deserve no mercy.A march of an estimated 4,000 people from the Paris town hall to the Assemblée Nationale began peacefully, but ended in violence and failed to reach its destination when some of the demonstrators – including a man identified by police as a former professional boxer – attacked a group of gendarmes in riot gear blocking a pedestrian bridge across the river Seine. A riverboat restaurant was set on fire.Nearby, a small group stole a fork-lift truck from a construction site and smashed down the door to a ministry building containing the office of , the government spokesman, who was forced to flee under escort.“Once again, extreme violence has come to attack the republic – its security forces, its representatives, its symbols,” Mr Macron said on Twitter. “Those who commit these acts forget the core of our civil pact. Justice will be done. Everyone must pull themselves together to prepare for debate and dialogue.”, the interior minister, played down the significance of Saturday’s protests and said that 56,500 members of the security forces, more than one per demonstrator according to the official figures, had been mobilised to quell unrest.“You can see that this movement is not representative of France,” he told LCI television. Although most of the demonstrations had passed off peacefully, he said, “at the end there were numerous provocations and attacks. Town halls were attacked – those in  and  – and institutions like the high court in , and gendarmeries.”The  protests were triggered by motorists’ anger over fuel prices that have risen as a result of green taxes introduced by the Macron government to reduce emissions, but the movement has since developed into an inchoate series of anti-government and anti-establishment demonstrations.Mr Macron’s U-turn on the taxes and the promise of €10 billion of extra government spending to help the poor have not mollified the hardline protesters who continue to take to the streets on Saturdays.– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019 Subscribe.

Photograph: Wolfgang RattayFrench president  and German chancellor  will meet on Tuesday morning in the coronation room of the town hall in the German city of Aachen to sign a new “Treaty of Franco-German Co-operation and Integration”, 56 years after Charles de Gaulle and  signed the Treaty of the Élysée, which is the cornerstone of reconciliation between the two countries.The new treaty will “complement, not replace” the previous treaty, an adviser to Macron stressed, calling it the “treaty of convergence”.The 28-article, 13-page text is a bland commitment to relaunch a raft of Franco-German projects. Brexit and the spread of populist nationalism across the continent have created “an objectively difficult context” in the EU, the presidential adviser said. In the run-up to European parliamentary elections, “It is all the more important to have a Franco-German couple that is on the offensive, efficient, engaged and co-ordinated,” he added.Paris and Berlin already co-ordinate their positions before every EU summit.  As noted in the treaty, “The two countries consult one another regularly at every level before important European events.” and  recently launched programmes to build tanks and aircraft together. The treaty notes vaguely that they will “elaborate a shared approach to arms exports”.A mutual defence clause requires the two countries “to assist each other by all means at their disposal, including armed force, in the event of armed aggression against one of their territories”.That commitment already exists under article 42, paragraph seven, of the Treaty on , and in article five of the North Atlantic Treaty. These texts “inspired each other”, the adviser said. “They mean there are concentric circles, of German and French proximity, within the EU and then . ”The twinning of French and German schools and towns is to be relaunched. The treaty provides legal means to harmonise social charges, taxation and rules on either side of the border. More than 50,000 French people cross the border to work in Germany each day.The text aspires to a “Franco-German economic zone” and establishes a joint council of economic experts which will try to bring opposing economic visions closer together. “In France, we insist on a budget for the euro zone, on stimulus,” the adviser said, whereas the German Council of Economic Experts “often reproaches the German government for overspending”.French and German television networks have begun work on a “Franco-German digital information platform”. And the two countries will co-operate in dismantling the French nuclear power plant on the border at Fessenheim.Macron has been weakened by the revolt, and Merkel will leave office in the autumn of 2021 at the latest. Under their rule, France and Germany have not been able to agree on a budget for the euro zone or the taxation of internet giants, both major goals for Macron. Critics say the new treaty lacks ambition because it does not address the euro zone, the integration of migrants or social and environmental policy.The French believe they may find it easier to work with Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who has replaced Merkel at the head of the . “AKK” is from the Rhineland border region and is fluent in French.Despite its banality, the treaty became the subject of conspiracy theories on the far right and among protesters. In repeated television appearances and on her Twitter feed, , the leader of the Rassemblement National, has accused Macron of “betraying the French nation” by “signing the treaty of Aachen in secret”, “selling off pieces of our country” and “intending to share our seat on the [UN] Security Council with Germany”.The German vice-chancellor and finance minister  suggested last November that France might “transform [its security council seat] into the seat of the European Union”. It would be possible for the actual representative to always be French, Scholz said. France refused.Article five of the new treaty foresees “exchanges” between the French representative on the security council and the German ambassador, who holds a temporary seat for two years. Article eight expresses French support for Germany’s quest to obtain a permanent seat on the council. Germany has long sought such a seat. So have Brazil, India and Japan. Subscribe.

If there are no changes, we will veto Brexit,” he tweeted. Photograph: Juanjo Martin/EPAA last-minute Spanish threat to derail Sunday’s  summit in Brussels appears to have been averted by agreement by diplomats to language which reaffirms Madrid’s veto over future EU talks which impinge on .There was initial scepticism in Madrid on Friday night, and reports that  had demanded written commitments from London, but diplomats in Brussels were expressing confidence that the summit would not be held up.The text of the clarification statement by the 27 EU states will not be part of the withdrawal agreement or the political declaration, which are to be approved at Sunday’s summit, and will not have to be signed off by London.The statement is expected also to include language on fishing – the expectation that a deal will be agreed by July 2020, and that it must protect the current rights of European fleets to fish British waters – and on the possible one-year to two-year extension to the transition period.In this regard, a clear warning is issued to the UK that it must not hold back or delay in implementing commitments made in the withdrawal agreement: “Any decision on the extension of the transition period will take into account the fulfilment of obligations by the  under the agreement, including its protocols,” the new language is reported to say.There was speculation in Brussels – now discounted – that Spanish prime minister , currently on a visit to Cuba, would fly in on Saturday to meet either British prime minister  or European Commission president , who will be meeting on Saturday evening ahead of the summit.Commission sources insist the latter meeting, whose agenda is still vague, will not involve any reopening of either of the documents. Nor will the summit, officials agreed on Friday.Leaders will gather in Brussels on Sunday at 9.30am (local time) for the summit, which will initially be addressed by  president . All being well, a final press conference is scheduled for midday.On Friday the Spanish objections appeared as if they might upset the carefully choreographed show. “After my conversation with Theresa May, our positions remain far away,” Mr Sánchez tweeted in Spanish and English on Thursday night. “My government will always defend the interests of Spain. If there are no changes, we will veto Brexit.”In practice the Spanish cannot veto the withdrawal agreement, which will be agreed by leaders by a strong qualified majority vote (under the complicated formula in the treaty, that is 72 per cent of the 27 remainer member states, or 20 member states representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU27).But the leaders would strongly prefer a unanimous decision and are concerned at the prospects of Mrs May facing British newspaper headlines that suggest she was humiliated by the Spanish. Everything, sources say, should be “done and dusted” by Sunday so that she can emerge triumphant from the meeting.Spanish sources say that the dispute on Gibraltar reflects perceptions of an unwillingness on the part of the commission to privilege a Spanish vital national concern in the talks in the way that Irish national concerns and views, notably on the Border issue, were explicitly privileged. Britain’s contested sovereignty over Gibraltar is a huge domestic issue for Spanish politicians.The Spanish were particularly angered by the dropping of language from early drafts of the withdrawal agreement – at British instigation? – that made clear that, as the EU March 2017 negotiating guidelines agreed by leaders provided, “no agreement between the EU and the UK” could apply to Gibraltar “without an agreement between” London and Spain. An explicit Spanish veto.The EU Council’s legal service, backed by that of the commission, is understood to to have argued that that obligation is implied and still stands in the final text. Madrid says there is ambiguity and insists it wants it in writing, “to be sure, to be sure”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Will Oliver/BloombergAmid intense political and diplomatic activity ahead of Sunday’s crucial European summit, British prime minister Theresa May travels to Brussels on Saturday to finalise the agreements on which she has staked her political future and the relationship between the European Union and the UK.Senior political and official sources in Dublin and Brussels said on Friday night that they expected the summit to adopt both the withdrawal treaty – the legally binding document that will govern the UK’s exit if ratified by the European and British parliaments – and the declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.On Friday, at a meeting in Brussels of the “sherpas” – the personal representatives of the national leaders – the texts of both agreements were regarded as settled, according to authoritative sources.A Spanish threat to derail the summit appeared to have been averted by agreement among officials to language which reaffirms Madrid’s veto over future UK-EU talks impinging on Gibraltar.The sherpas agreed to a clarification statement by the 27 remaining EU states, which will not be part of the withdrawal agreement or the political declaration, though initial responses in Madrid were sceptical. But no more than Mrs May, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez will not be allowed by his fellow EU leaders to reopen the agreed treaty text, Brussels sources said.Mrs May will be in Brussels on Saturday to meet the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the president of the Council – the group of EU leaders that meets on Sunday – Donald Tusk.On Friday, Mrs May took her pitch to the British people over the airwaves, telling the BBC: “I don’t think they [the EU 27] will come to us and say we’ll get a better deal” if the British parliament votes down the deal.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said at a meeting in Sligo that his expectation was that the EU would be able to sign off on the withdrawal agreement on Sunday. He said there was an issue in relation to Spain “but I am confident that can be worked out”.Mr Varadkar also spoke to Mr Juncker on Friday to inform him that the Dáil had approved the withdrawal agreement and that the Government was happy with the text of the future relationship declaration.Mr Varadkar told reporters in Sligo that if the withdrawal treaty was approved, it would ensure that “there won’t be any changes at all for these two years, if not longer, giving businesses time to prepare and also gives us time to negotiate a future relationship”.The Taoiseach said that lots of people “may be criticising this but I don’t see anyone putting anything better on the table”.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney also spoke to new British  secretary Stephen Barclay by phone on Friday.In Northern Ireland, the DUP’s party conference will be addressed on Saturday by arch-Brexiteer Boris Johnson, who will urge the party to maintain its opposition to the withdrawal treaty when it comes before the House of Commons for a vote in the coming weeks. On Friday night the British chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond addressed a party dinner appealing for support for the deal. But on Saturday DUP leaders will again stress their opposition, warning Mrs May that DUP support for her government was in question if she continued with the present deal.Several sources said that with the treaty and declaration texts agreed, EU leaders would seek to assist Mrs May when they meet in Brussels on Sunday morning. “They’ll avoid any triumphalism, avoid a long meeting – just get the business done,” said one source.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Abdul Abeissa/AFP/Getty ImagesPolice used tear gas on the Champs-Élysées after a day of largely peaceful demonstrations in Paris on the fifth straight weekend of protests by France’s “yellow vest” movement.The demonstrations against France’s high cost of living were significantly smaller on Saturday than at previous rallies, some of which scarred parts of Paris with vandalism and looting.A few thousand people marched up and down the famed shopping street in Paris, a spirited yet peaceful gathering that sunk into violence as the afternoon wore on.Riot police clashed with demonstrators as the occasional tourist darted from their hotel or a brave Christmas shopper took a peek at the neighbourhood’s mostly boarded-up storefronts.By late afternoon, a water cannon in a line of police vans confronting protesters sprayed water to disperse them.Firefighters put out a blaze on a side street leading to the Champs-Élysées and limited scuffles broke out between protesters and police.By early evening, police had cleared the avenue and reopened it to traffic.Protesters made it clear that they wanted to keep up the pressure, even if their numbers were far smaller than in previous weeks, which saw rioters smashing and looting stores and setting up burning barricades in the streets.French law enforcement was out in force. About 8,000 police and 14 armoured vehicles were deployed in Paris for the demonstration, and streets of central Paris were honeycombed with checkpoints where officers in riot gear checked bags and coats for weapons.Police said 115 people were taken into custody in Paris, most for banding together to commit acts of violence, and a small number were injured.Police in riot gear tackled one protester and dragged him off the Champs-Élysées, while his friends said he was doing nothing but exercising right to protest.The “yellow vest” movement, which takes its name from the fluorescent safety vests French motorists must have in their vehicles, started in mid-November with protests at junctions and roundabouts against fuel tax increases, but quickly became a wider mobilisation against Macron’s economic policies.Without any clear leadership, it has attracted a wide range of disgruntled people across France’s political spectrum, including some violent militants.Yellow vest protests were also being held in other parts of , blocking roads and highways.Loic Bollay (44), marching on the Champs-Élysées, said the protests were more subdued but the movement would go on until the demonstrators’ grievances were addressed. “Since the  attack, it is calmer, but I think next Saturday and the following Saturdays . . . it will come back.”On Friday, president Emmanuel Macron called for a return to calm in France while several unions and politicians had called on protesters to stay off the streets, after four people were killed in a gun attack at a Christmas market in Strasbourg on Tuesday.The number of deaths linked to the protest rose to seven after Belgian police said a man accidentally crashed his car on Friday night into a truck that had stalled at a yellow vest roadblock on the French-Belgian border.– AP/Reuters Subscribe.

But the demonstrations were noticeably smaller than in previous weeks, possibly in response to the Strasbourg attack or to the cold, rainy weather.Police fired water cannons and teargas in the afternoon to disperse groups of protesters in sporadic, brief clashes on the Champs-Élysées and adjacent streets. Topless feminist activists braved the cold to face off with security forces, a few metres away from the Élysée Palace, the president’s residence. And French media showed footage of clashes between police and protesters in , western , and further south in  and .The “yellow vest” protest movement started in mid-November with demonstrations at junctions and roundabouts against fuel tax increases, but quickly became a wider mobilisation against Mr Macron’s economic policies.

Photograph: Ian Langsdon/EPARioters in Paris torched motorbikes and set barricades ablaze on the upmarket Boulevard Saint-Germain on Saturday, as “yellow vest” protesters returned to the streets to demonstrate against high living costs and the perceived indifference of president .The latest “yellow vest” street marches began peacefully in the French capital but degenerated in the afternoon as protesters threw missiles at riot police blocking bridges over the Seine river.Officers fired tear gas to prevent protesters crossing the river and reaching the National Assembly. One riverboat restaurant was set ablaze in the unrest, and a policeman was wounded when he was struck by a bicycle hurled from a street above the riverbank.Two months after they started blocking roads, occupying highway tollbooths and staging sometimes-violent street protests in Paris, the “yellow vest” demonstrators wanted to inject new momentum into their movement, which had weakened over the holidays.Mr Macron’s government, shaken by the unrest, had this week hardened its stance against the uprising, branding the protesters as agitators seeking to overthrow the government.Driving the unrest is anger, particularly among low-paid workers, over a squeeze on household incomes and a belief that Mr Macron is deaf to citizens’ needs as he enacts reforms seen as favouring the wealthy.“They have no right to leave us in the shit like this,” said protester  in Paris. “We’re fed up with having to pay out the whole time, we’ve had enough of this slavery, we should be able to live on our salaries.”There were similar protests in other cities across  on Saturday, including in , ,  and .An estimated 25,000 took to the streets nationwide in what was dubbed Act VIII of the “yellow vests” movement, BFM TV reported, barely 10 per cent of the number in the first weeks of protests, but higher than the figure for last weekend.As darkness fell, officers dispersed scores of protesters gathered on the Champs-Élysées. Television images showed hooded youths setting a car alight on a side street, but there was no repeat of the damage done during the protests in late November, when shops were looted, banks were vandalised and the Arc de Triomphe was defaced.Authorities have blamed the worst of the violence in recent weeks on anarchists, anti-capitalists and extreme groups on the fringes of the “yellow vest” movement.The protests come 18 months into Mr Macron’s tenure and amid his drive to reshape the economy. They have already forced concessions from the 41-year-old president.Last month, Mr Macron promised tax cuts for pensioners, wage rises for the poorest workers and the scrapping of planned fuel tax increases to quell the unrest, at a cost to the state of €10 billion.The announcement marked the first big U-turn for a president elected on a platform of breaking with traditional French politics and liberalising the heavily-regulated economy.Faced with record-low popularity ratings, Mr Macron is expected to pen a letter soon to the nation setting out his plans for the coming months. These include a nationwide debate with citizens on ecological, fiscal and institutional questions, the results of which he promises will feed into the policy-making process. – Reuters Subscribe.

One of the security agents working with the TV crew was beaten while he was on the ground and had his nose broken, with footage of the incident widely shared on social media.In Paris, an LCI reporter was pushed to the ground as demonstrators tried to take away her camera, the station said, adding that it will take legal action against the attackers.Several other stations, including BFM TV and franceinfo, on Sunday showed images of reporters being hassled or pushed around during Saturday’s yellow vest marches.Reporters without Borders secretary-general  called on authorities to take action.“This is anti-democratic blackmail from people who consider they can beat up journalists if they disagree with the way events are covered,” he said on  Info radio.Interior minister  said on Twitter that anyone attacking reporters will be brought to justice.“In our democracy, the press is free . . . attacking journalists is attacking the right to inform,” he said.France has been rocked by yellow vest protests against Macron’s reforms since the middle of November in a movement that has no designated leaders and is not linked to political parties or unions.Started as a protest against high fuel prices, the movement has morphed into a fight for social justice and more direct democracy. Several demonstrations have degenerated into violent clashes with police.Over the coming week, Macron will launch three months of national debate to air yellow-vest grievances in the hope of appeasing the movement, which has undermined his authority and upended his reform drive. – (Reuters) Subscribe.

Their movement then developed into a broader revolt against the government.About 69,000 people attended the latest Saturday protests, including 4,000 in Paris, a lower turnout than the previous weekend, France’s interior minister said.However, the eye injury suffered by well-known activist  attracted more television coverage on Sunday than the “red scarves” march, as it heightened debate over use by police of dispersal grenades and so-called “flashball” pellet guns.Mr Rodrigues’s lawyer said his client will be disabled for life as a result of the eye injury.To help quell discontent, Mr Macron this month launched a series of public debates that he has promised will lead to changes. – Reuters/Guardian Subscribe.

Photograph: Daniel Mihailescuu/AFP/Getty ImagesAs the  braces for what is likely to be a tumultuous year, its presidency has passed to a country that is enduring turbulent times of its own.During its first six-month term in the post,  is due to oversee Brexit, EU budget talks and European parliamentary elections, while trying to keep a lid on its own bitter political power struggles and widespread anger at the government.Since taking power in 2017, Romania’s Social Democrats (PSD) have rowed back on anti-corruption reforms, sparking the country’s biggest street protests since its 1989 revolution and causing concern in Brussels and Washington.A beneficiary of the softer legal regime could be , the PSD leader who cannot hold office due to convictions for vote rigging and graft, but controls the government of premier  from behind the scenes.The PSD sacked several of her predecessors who clashed with Mr Dragnea, and last year the government forced Romanian president  to fire , who as the country’s top anti-corruption prosecutor jailed powerful officials and businessmen and won wide international praise.The move alarmed the EU, which still conducts special monitoring of Romania’s anti-corruption efforts 11 years after it joined the bloc.The government’s rhetoric has done nothing to soothe Brussels, as Mr Dragnea and allies echoed the leaders of  and  in dismissing EU criticism and suggesting liberal philanthropist  was funding Romania’s protests.Though the EU presidency-holder’s tasks are largely organisational,  president Jean-Claude Juncker has voiced fears that Romania’s fiery domestic disputes and populist politics could be unwanted distractions, at a time when the bloc aims to show strength and unity over Brexit.Mr Juncker told Germany’s newspaper last weekend that he still had concerns for Romania, even though it was now “technically well-prepared” for the role.“I think the government in Bucharest hasn’t yet fully understood what it means to take the chair over the EU countries. For judicious negotiations, you also need a readiness to listen to others and the firm will to put your own wishes aside. With that in mind, I have some doubts,” he said.“A united front is needed at home in order to promote the unity of  during the presidency of the [EU] council,” he added.In response, senior PSD member Mihai Fifor complained that “Romania is treated like a second-rate nation by some EU officials” and vowed that his country “will no longer take being scolded or sanctioned for things that happen everywhere in Europe”.He also suggested that Mr Juncker was being misinformed by , the head of the European Commission office in Romania.That drew a scathing response from commission spokeswoman , who said such “personal attacks” were “unacceptable”.“We will not let our trusted ambassador become a target for attacks as part of domestic political disputes,” she added.In a New Year message to the nation, Ms Dancila struck a conciliatory note.“This is a national project that must unite us – state institutions, political forces and civil society, all Romanians wherever they may be,” she said of the presidency.“I assure you that we are ready for a successful mandate, so that a dignified Romania rises and regains its rightful place and importance in Europe and the world.”In his own New Year address, Mr Iohannis alluded to the government’s legal reforms and anti-EU rhetoric, by urging his country to build its future around “courage, civic involvement and strong attachment to the rule of law”.“Let’s capitalise on this opportunity and prove that Romania is seriously involved in consolidating the European project,” he added.After describing Romania in November as being “in the 11th hour and totally unprepared” for the presidency, he recently said his country could handle the role.Yet a lasting truce remains unlikely between Mr Iohannis and a government that he has called an “accident of Romanian democracy” that is “run by the criminal Dragnea through intermediaries”.Mr Dragnea and his allies will also find it hard to hold fire against Mr Iohannis, who they have threatened to impeach and who is expected to run for re-election later this year.“The political angle is going to be complicated, because in 2019 we will have presidential elections and already the nationalistic vibe is very present in all discourses of the ruling coalition,” said  of the  think tank in Bucharest.The feud between the government and Mr Iohannis was “already an embarrassment and may rise up to the European level. The two sides aren’t talking to each other and I don’t expect it to get better,” she added.“In this situation my best hope is that the EU presidency will sit on the shoulders of bureaucrats, without much hope that Romania is going to be a driving force in any topics . . . If it’s left to the bureaucrats then I think we’ll do a decent job.” Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

Photograph: EPAPope Francis has offered his Christmas wish for fraternity among people of different faiths, races or ideas. He urged the world to put aside “partisan interests” to find a political solution to wars in Syria and Yemen and conflicts in Ukraine and on the Korean peninsula. Addressing tens of thousands of tourists, pilgrims and Romans in St Peter’s Square, Francis said on Tuesday that the universal message of Christmas was that “God is a good father and we are all brothers and sisters”. Without fraternity, the pope said “even our best plans and projects risk being soulless and empty”. He added that “our differences, then, are not a detriment or a danger; they are a source of richness”. Francis made his appeal as trends toward nationalism, fuelling suspicion of migrants and refugees, have gained traction in much of the developed world. Francis urged the international community to “work decisively for a political solution that can put aside divisions and partisan interests, so that the Syrian people, especially all those who were forced to leave their own lands and seek refuge elsewhere, can return to live in peace in their own country”. He said he hoped an internationally-brokered truce for Yemen would bring relief to that country’s people, especially children “exhausted by war and famine”. Other Christmas wishes expressed by the pope included one for dialogue among Israelis and Palestinians so they can “undertake a journey of peace that can put an end to a conflict that for over 70 years has rent the land chosen by the Lord to show his face of love”. He also cited conflicts and vulnerable populations in much of Africa, in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Ukraine. He expressed hope that the “bonds of fraternity uniting the Korean peninsula” would be consolidated. On Monday, Francis celebrated Christmas Eve Mass for the faithful in St Peter’s Basilica.  Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>
<doc url="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/france-to-increase-hpv-vaccinations-in-fight-against-cervical-cancer-1.3781996" titre = "France to increase HPV vaccinations in fight against cervical cancer" date = "Mon, Feb 4, 2019, 19:30">    France has one of the lowest rates of uptake of the HPV vaccination in Europe, due to ‘unfounded rumours’ around its safety, says Dr Elisabete Weiderpass. Photograph:  Matthew Busch/Washington Post/Getty Images is launching a campaign of systematic screening for the human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes cervical cancer. The country is also stepping up vaccinations of teenagers against HPV.About 1,100 French women die annually of cervical cancer, and another 3,000 are diagnosed with the disease, which is preventable.A statement by Dr , director of the  (IARC), which is part of the  (WHO), said that the HPV vaccination is “safe, efficacious and critical” in the fight against cervical cancer.Cervical cancer is the fourth most frequent cancer among women, the IARC said. About 570,000 cases were diagnosed in the world last year, and 310,000 women died of the disease. The IARC says 460,000 women will have died annually by 2040 if more preventive measures are not implemented.The French 2014-2019 cancer plan set an objective of vaccinating 60 per cent of all girls aged 11 to 14, but fewer than 20 per cent have been vaccinated, because of widespread distrust of the vaccination. The WHO recommends that all girls aged nine to 14 be vaccinated, before they commence sexual activity.“Unfounded rumours hamper the increase of the vaccination, which is crucial for preventing cervical cancer,” Dr Weiderpass said.France has one of the lowest vaccination rates in . HPV also causes cancer of the anus, mouth, tongue, throat and uterus, and can be transmitted orally.An estimated 70 per cent of men and women are exposed to the virus, but in most cases, the body eliminates it naturally.Doctors warn that women should not stop having cervical smear tests after menopause. More than a third of new cases of cervical cancer in France strike women under the age of 50, but four in five deaths from the disease occur after age 50.Vaccination and screening are the two main strategies for preventing cervical cancer. Seventeen million French women between the ages of 25 and 65 will receive letters through the post this month urging them to have a free smear test. Sixty per cent of French women have a cervical smear once every three years, as recommended by the WHO.Women who do not respond will receive a follow-up letter one year later. The  says 90 per cent of cervical cancer cases could be avoided with a smear test every three years.The  (HAS) will decide later this year whether to vaccinate boys as well as girls against HPV. France’s minister for health Agnès Buzyn says she is favourable to the measure, but will follow the HAS’s recommendation. A US study in 2016 showed that men were twice as likely as women to contract cancer of the throat and mouth from HPV.In an article published in the medical journal the Lancet last October, Australian doctors reported they expect to eradicate cervical cancer within a decade.  launched free vaccinations for 12- and 13-year-old girls in 2007, one year after the vaccine became available . The campaign was extended to boys of the same age in 2013.Three-quarters of Australian teenagers are now vaccinated. As a result only 1.1 per cent of women aged 18 to 24 were infected with HPV in 2015, compared with 22.7 per cent in 2005. Scandinavian countries have also vaccinated a high percentage of teenagers and have seen a significant drop in cases of cervical cancer. Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

Law enforcers said they had found illegal religious literature at the premises where the prayer group met.A district court in Oryol sentenced Mr Christensen to six years in prison on Wednesday for organising the activities of a religious organisation in full knowledge that it was banned. Russian prosecutors had recommended a tougher, 6½-year jail term.Defence lawyers said they would appeal against the sentence.Jehovah’s Witnesses have faced increasing pressure since Russia’s supreme court declared the US-based organisation extremist in April 2017 and ordered its property to be turned over to the state. Russia’s justice ministry then issued a blanket ban on Jehovah’s Witnesses, paving the way for criminal charges to be brought against believers for proselytising or simply gathering together.Dozens of Jehovah’s Witnesses are facing criminal charges in Russia, where the group has an estimated 175,000 followers., Denmark’s foreign minister, said he was “deeply concerned” by the Oryol court ruling on Wednesday and urged Russia to respect freedom of worship. The Danish foreign ministry “will continue to follow closely and assist Dennis Christensen should he decide to appeal”, he wrote on Twitter.Mr Christensen’s case has attracted the support of international rights groups, which called for his immediate and unconditional release.“The Russian authorities should respect, protect, promote and fulfil the right to freedom of belief enshrined in the country’s Constitution and human rights treaties to which Russia is a state party,”  said in a statement.The guilty verdict handed to Mr Christensen was “a disgrace”, said , deputy director of the  and Central Asia division at Human Rights Watch. “It’s shocking that the authorities are putting him through this ordeal for nothing more than peacefully practising his faith.”Jehovah’s Witnesses were first registered in Russia in 1991 as the country embraced religious freedom in the wake of the Soviet Union’s collapse.Some political commentators said the organisation’s US origins and its followers’ refusal to participate in military service might explain the Russian authorities’ growing aversion to its activities. Some pointed out that as committed pacifists, Jehovah’s Witnesses were an easy target for persecution as they were unlikely to become radicalised. Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

Romanian justice minister  has written to EU colleagues claiming that Ms Codruta Kovesi’s work involved “secret and anti-democratic pacts” with the security services, which “bring to mind the intermingling of politics, intelligence and law enforcement so notorious in our nation during Communist rule.”She is now also being investigated over alleged abuse of office, bribery and making false statements by a new department to investigate magistrates, which was formed by the government and is led by its loyalists despite widespread criticism.“The [European] Commission is closely following the latest developments in the context of the selection procedure. It is crucial that all candidates proposed by an independent selection committee be treated fairly throughout the process,” EU spokesman  said on Thursday.“As far as the justice system in Romania is concerned, I have repeatedly reiterated that an independent, professional judiciary is of great importance,” Romanian media quoted him as saying.Ms Codruta Kovesi (45) told Romanian television the investigation against her was “a sort of revenge for the complaint I made at the European Court of Human Rights”, over dismissal from the DNA.“The second reason is clearly an attempt to stop my candidacy for EU prosecutor,” she added.“I will go to Brussels, I will explain that I am innocent and that the opening of proceedings against me is a ruse.”Mr Toader sacked her for alleged abuse of power last year and Romanian president  reluctantly signed off on her dismissal after the constitutional court in Bucharest ruled that he could not block the decision.Her five-year stint running the DNA won great international praise, however, as the agency prosecuted thousands of influential local and national figures, including about a dozen government ministers, some 50 senators and deputies, and two former premiers.She has been a sharp thorn in the side of several Romanian governments and particularly the Social Democrats (PSD), whose leader Liviu Dragnea cannot serve as premier due to convictions for vote rigging and abuse of office.Since taking power two years ago, the PSD has sought to increase political control of the judiciary and decriminalise some graft offences, to the benefit of Mr Dragnea and other members and powerful supporters of the party.An EU selection panel this month named Ms Kovesi as its first choice to lead the new European Public Prosecutor’s Office, which by 2021 is due to start investigating the theft of EU funds and major cross-border tax fraud.Senior German and Austrian politicians and the European People’s Party, the biggest bloc in the , have already backed her candidacy. Subscribe.

Photograph: Christophe Petit TessonAs bureau chief for British magazine the ,  got to know  earlier than most Macron-watchers. She first interviewed him in 2012, when he was economic adviser to then president François Hollande, and continued to talk to him after he became minister for the economy in 2014. She has interviewed him twice since he became president, and is probably the foreign journalist who knows him best.In the autumn of 2015, when Macron was still a cabinet minister, Pedder accompanied him from London to Paris on a small government jet, so she could interview him on the flight. They flew into a violent storm. “The plane was lurching around. I was clenching the seat handles and watching the lightning through the windows,” Pedder recalls. “Macron was absolutely unfazed by it. He continued talking the whole way through. I honestly wondered if he even noticed the storm was taking place. It told me a lot about his character. Subsequently, a lot of people talked about his unflappable nature.”Pedder’s book, , will be published by Bloomsbury on June 14th. Its portrayal of  is far more upbeat than her previous book, , published in Paris in 2012. “Then, I was accused of French-bashing,” Pedder laughs. Now she fears being accused of over-optimism.Macron is an atypical Frenchman. A passage in Pedder’s book recounts France’s past embrace of melancholy as part of its identity. “When Macron came along with all this optimism, it sat very uneasily with that national character,” she says. “[The novelist]  said Macron was imposing a medical cure of optimism on the French. A radio commentator said that ‘Under Macron, the French have resigned themselves to being optimistic,’ as if that required particular effort.”Macron, Pedder says, “believes very strongly” in optimism. “He believes it philosophically and I think it’s part of his character. He believes it is possible to create a better society.”Macron’s critics reproach him for wanting to be a “Jupiterian” president. “The French don’t like personal arrogance. That’s the greatest risk of his presidency, if he doesn’t find a way to temper or deal with that perception. The French are a rebellious people.”When Pedder last interviewed Macron at the Élysée Palace, she asked if he had made any mistakes. To her surprise, he regretted having called strikers “lazy” and alluding to “those who are nothing” in railway stations. The remarks were taken for condescension, which was not how he meant them.Contrary to his public image, Pedder says, Macron is capable of self-criticism. She sees the influence of , the Christian philosopher who Macron worked with. “Testing your hypotheses against reality, that’s what Ricoeur taught him. He is constantly putting his presidency through the microscope and scanning it and checking it and taking a look at it . . . He is constantly testing his own ability to exercise power in the way he thinks is efficient and in the interest of the nation.”Domestically, Macron’s adversaries are all but vanquished. The far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon mobilised only 38,900 people in Paris for his “popular tide” on May 26th. The far left had hoped to “converge struggles” as students and workers did in the May 1968 revolution. “It doesn’t seem to have taken hold,” Pedder observes. Public opinion regarding the ongoing rail strike has taken the opposite trajectory to the 1995 transport strikes, with 64 per cent now supporting the government .In his first year as president, Macron “has grown into the office”, Pedder says. “One wasn’t sure he would be able to hold his own among world leaders.” Macron dared to criticise Donald Trump’s policies before Republicans in his April 25th address to the joint houses of Congress. “This guy is gutsier than a lot of people realised before he became president. He’s tougher than a lot of people thought. He can be very ruthless when he wants to be.”In  and the world, Pedder continues, “One of Macron’s problems is who does he work with? Who are his partners?  is constrained by her party.  is distracted by Brexit. Italy is facing its own crisis. Where are strong partners to stand up for the world trading system, for international rules, for multilateralism, for all the things he believes in? He can’t do it by himself. It’s a bigger problem than just Europe. He is very isolated.” Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

Photograph:  Christophe Archambault/AFP/Getty ImagesFrench president  came under fire on Thursday after his office briefly suspended one of his aides for beating a May Day protester and posing as a police officer, but did not inform law enforcement authorities.Critics of Mr Macron said the incident reinforced perceptions of a lofty, out-of-touch president, coming on the heels of controversies over government spending on official crockery, a swimming pool built at a presidential retreat, and cutting remarks by the president about the costs of welfare.A video from a May Day rally released by  newspaper showed a man wearing a police helmet and identification tag dragging a woman away and then beating a demonstrator. He was later recognised as a member of the French presidency staff.“The staff member, , had been given permission to witness the demonstrations only as an observer,” presidential spokesman Bruno Roger-Petit said in a hastily arranged video statement.“Clearly, he went beyond this... He was immediately summoned by the president’s chief of staff and given a 15-day suspension. This came as punishment for unacceptable behaviour.”On a trip to southwestern  on Thursday, Mr Macron declined to answer questions from reporters on the subject, saying only in a video posted by a  reporter: “I didn’t come here to see you. I came to see Mr Mayor.”The Paris prosecutor, which was unaware of the matter before Thursday, launched a preliminary investigation against Mr Benalla on suspicion of violence, usurping the function of a police officer and using signs reserved for public authorities.The presidency’s handling of the matter was condemned by opposition parties, which argued that not only was the punishment too lenient but that the incident should have promptly referred to judicial authorities.“This video is shocking. Today we have the feeling that in Macron’s entourage one is above the law,” , president of the conservative Republicains, told  1 radio.Far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon told reporters: “If we accept that anybody can be a policeman alongside the police then we no longer have the rule of law. This man is the eyes and ears of the prince [Mr Macron].”Some deputies in Mr Macron’s centrist party also called for Mr Benalla to be dismissed. Prime minister , who denounced “shocking images” in the video, said it was now up to courts to decide.Labour unions hold demonstrations every year on May 1st in France and clashes with police are not uncommon.After the 15-day suspension, Mr Benalla was brought back into the president’s immediate entourage. He appears in multiple Reuters’ photos alongside Mr Macron during public events.Mr Benalla also helped organise the festivities surrounding the return home of France’s World Cup-winning football team earlier this week and is seen next to the team bus. – Reuters Subscribe.

The night’s meeting was described by the commission as constructive. “We are on course for tomorrow,” a spokesman tweeted. The summit will now definitely proceed tomorrow morning and will unanimously approve both the divorce deal, the Withdrawal Agreement, and a political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and UK.The  will initially be a gathering of the 27 remainer states’ leaders followed by one with Ms May, in the words of Council President Donald Tusk, to “jointly consider the next steps”. The meetings are expected to be over before lunchtime.Ireland will be represented by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee. Last-minute assurances from the UK and the EU 27 on , reaffirming Spain’s right to a veto on future EU talks impinging on the British colony, were being claimed by Spanish prime minister  as a major diplomatic coup. He insisted the UK would now have to open talks on “joint sovereignty” of Gibraltar, over which Spain has had a claim since the military dictatorship of Francisco Franco.A British spokesman denied the statement in a letter to the Spanish government represented a climbdown on its part. The text simply asserts that there are no implications in the Withdrawal Agreement on the “territorial scope” of agreements between the EU and the UK to be agreed by the summit this morning. Brussels sources said the declarations merely reiterated the status quo.Mr Sanchez, who faces strong domestic political pressures over Gibraltar and local elections next week, was keen, however, to big it up: “Once the UK has left the EU, Gibraltar’s political, legal and even geographic relationship with the EU will go through Spain …“Spain will be a fundamental pillar of the relationship between Gibraltar and the EU as a whole,” he said.“When it comes to the future political declaration, the European Council and the  have backed Spain’s position, and backed it as never before. “In these fundamental future negotiations, we’re going to have to talk about joint sovereignty and many other things with the UK.”Ms May’s arrived at 6pm local time for the meeting with Mr Juncker. She then met Mr Tusk and a meeting with European Parliament president Antonio Tajani was also mooted.In his traditional letter inviting EU leaders to attend the summit and discussing its agenda, Mr Tusk urged them to endorse both documents. He said they had clearly achieved the main objectives set out in the negotiators’ mandate, including the prevention of a hard border in Ireland.Mr Juncker then met for dinner with Italian prime minister  to discuss the commission’s warning that it will impose sanctions on Rome unless the government substantially revises its budget.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Work was continuing, the commission said, with Mrs May adding later that there were “some further issues that need resolution”.Mrs May arrived at about 5.30pm local time and shook hands with Mr Juncker, refusing to answer shouted questions, and after the meeting disappeared without comment. Commission officials were saying next to nothing. All sides appeared to accept that the withdrawal agreement (WA) cannot be reopened and that Sunday’s summit will effectively just rubber-stamp it. Mrs May acknowledged as much in the Commons on Wednesday, while German chancellor Angela Merkel told the  there was no question of renegotiating the deal now.Mrs May’s focus on Wednesday night was on the final tweaking of the declaration, which she hopes to sell to her sceptics as providing the reassurances and safeguards they are looking for and believe are lacking in the WA.On Northern Ireland, the political declaration is now expected to include language on the Border that will reflect Mrs May’s promise to explore technological solutions as an alternative to the backstop. The withdrawal agreement, in both the draft produced in March and in its final form, allows for “alternative arrangements” to ensure that the Border remains open. London is playing up the formula.But she also gave a new version in the Commons on Wednesday of how the backstop could be creatively interpreted – the government, she said, could agree to keep the entire UK aligned with EU regulations rather than allowing Northern Ireland to diverge from Great Britain.“If we were in the situation where the backstop had to be in place for a matter of months, for example, it would be right for the  to give the commitment that we would not be looking to diverge from regulations during that period and that we would ensure that we kept that free access for the goods from Northern Ireland coming into Great Britain, as we have committed in the withdrawal agreement . . . and as we had committed previously. That will of course be a decision for us here,” she said.Nature abhors a vacuum and so Brussels was swirling with rumours and talk of “serious” blockages on the road to agreement on the declaration. Diplomats were sceptical of how serious such threats are. has threatened to veto the deal if its concerns on  are not met. And there are still reported to be French and other objections to the omission in the declaration of commitments to access to UK fishing waters and what some see as a dilution of “level-playing field” guarantees in the trade section.One senior diplomat said of the Spanish problem that “It should be all right on the day. An issue like this will have to be sorted beforehand.”Berlin weighed in to give the deadlocked discussion a kick forward, suggesting that a deal on the declaration needed to be finalised on Thursday, in time for capitals to consider it ahead of Sunday, or  might not attend the summit. After Mrs May’s statement on Wednesday night that timetable will not be met. But it was a clear message to Spain and others obstructing the deal that they should not be jeopardising the agreement and that there is limited sympathy for their stanceIt also appeared to be a message to London that any talk of negotiations on Sunday is out – the summit will be a formal approval of both documents and little more. Downing Street has been briefing unofficially that Mrs May hopes to engage in negotiations. Not if Dr Merkel has her way. Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

Photograph: John Thys/AFP/Getty ImagesThe word “backstop” gets only one mention. “The Parties recall their determination to replace the backstop solution on Northern  by a subsequent agreement that establishes alternative arrangements for ensuring the absence of a hard border on the island of Ireland on a permanent footing.”The political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and UK, an aspirational document without the binding legal force of the withdrawal agreement with which it will be agreed at a summit in  on Sunday, has clearly been drafted mainly to assist Theresa May. The British PM must persuade MPs – Tory, DUP and Labour – to support her when the two documents come to the Commons.It combines EU red line positions with copious implied references to her Chequers speech.It ticks many of the key boxes for her. Free trade without tariffs or quotas – tick. Security co-operation – tick. “Ambitious” but separate relationship – tick. Regulatory and legal autonomy – tick. Immigration controls – tick.And on  and its controversial backstop, a solid commitment to a frictionless border, an acknowledgment that all sides hope never to use the backstop and that there are possible acceptable “alternative arrangements”.This has been Downing Street’s mantra over the last few days. May will certainly be able to say the EU has been listening.Importantly, however, the declaration does not supersede or replace the withdrawal agreement and its legally binding commitment to the backstop. The insurance policy remains in place, although, as Irish officials emphasise, the UK is free to explore alternative approaches as long as they provide the same level of safeguard for the non-border. And as long as those alternative approaches are acceptable to the EU as sufficient to protect its single market.The document also reiterates that “The Parties recall their shared commitment to delivering a future PEACE PLUS programme to sustain work on reconciliation and a shared future in Northern Ireland, maintaining the current funding proportions for the future programme.It continues: “Both Parties affirm that the achievements, benefits and commitments of the peace process in Northern Ireland will remain of paramount importance to peace, stability and reconciliation. They agree that the Good Friday or  Agreement reached on 10 April 1998 by the  Government, the Irish Government and the other participants in the multi-party negotiations (the “1998 Agreement”) must be protected in all its parts, and that this extends to the practical application of the 1998 Agreement on the island of Ireland and to the totality of the relationships set out in the 1998 Agreement.”The declaration calls for “an ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic cooperation, law enforcement and criminal justice, foreign policy, security and defence and wider areas of cooperation based on a balance of rights and obligations, taking into account the principles of each Party.“This balance must ensure the autonomy of the Union’ s decision making and be consistent with the Union’s principles, in particular with respect to the integrity of the Single Market and the Customs Union and the indivisibility of the four freedoms.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

It is part of a package alongside the 500-page legal treaty, known as the withdrawal agreement, on Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.The EU and UK aim for “ambitious, broad, deep and flexible partnership across trade and economic cooperation, law enforcement and criminal justice, foreign policy, security... based on a balance of rights and obligations.”The EU and UK envisage “a trading relationship on goods that is as close as possible” and “comprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area, combining deep regulatory and customs cooperation, underpinned by provisions ensuring a level playing field.”The EU and UK expect “no tariffs, fees, charges or quantitative restrictions across all sectors, with ambitious customs arrangements that ... build and improve on the single customs territory provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement, which obviates the need for checks on rules of origin.”The EU and UK want an “ambitious customs arrangements”; “envisage making use of all available facilitative arrangements and technologies”; and are ready to consider “mutual recognition of trusted traders’ programmes, administrative cooperation in customs matters and mutual assistance, including for the recovery of claims related to taxes and duties.”EU, UK want to safeguard financial stability and will try to conclude their equivalence assessments “before the end of June 2020.”New EU-UK agreement on fisheries would form part of the overall new relationship between the two. The sides aim to “conclude and ratify their new fisheries agreement by 1 July 2020.”“Provisions to ensure this should cover state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change, and relevant tax matters.”Separately, EU and UK would agree that the post- transition period could be extended once “for up to one or two years” and Britain would have to go on contributing to the bloc’s budget accordingly.The sides want to ensure “passenger and cargo air connectivity” and provisions to mutually protect intellectual property rights.

<doc url="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/macron-and-may-to-discuss-brexit-at-president-s-summer-residence-1.3584777" titre = "Macron and May to discuss Brexit at president’s summer residence" date = "Fri, Aug 3, 2018, 01:00">    British prime minister Theresa May and French president Emmanuel Macron. “I imagine Macron will tell Theresa May ‘we will be as constructive as we can, but Monsieur Barnier will tell you our position’,” said a European diplomatBritish prime minister  and her husband Philip will break off their summer holiday on Friday to call on Emmanuel and  at the French president’s summer residence at Brégançon.The Mays are scheduled to arrive at 6pm French time. They will dine with the Macrons after a working meeting between the two leaders.May’s visit to Brégançon is the fourth high-level meeting between British and French officials in  in eight days. It has strengthened speculation that the UK is lobbying France to be more lenient in  negotiations.The 14th century fortress is built on a rocky outcrop jutting into the Mediterranean near Toulon, and was recently the subject of controversy. The Macrons claim the residence needs a swimming pool because their privacy cannot be protected in the sea.Chancellor of the exchequer  visited his French counterpart, , on Thursday, July 27th. Foreign secretary  met the French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Tuesday. The Brexit secretary  saw European affairs minister  on Thursday.However, the diplomatic offensive may be futile. France is determined that the UK not be seen to benefit from Brexit, and was considered the most hardline EU country even before Macron took office last year. Hunt has also visited Austria, Germany and Portugal in recent days, and British sources say the diplomatic flurry is more a function of the parliamentary recess than a British desire to divide and rule. Unlike their French counterparts, British cabinet ministers are also members of parliament and must be on hand to vote. A similar spate of continental visits occurred during the February recess.The Élysée refused to comment on the Macron-May summit, although an unnamed source at the Élysée told the it takes place at the request of Downing Street. A British source said the two leaders planned to meet for some time, and that the French, as owners of Brégançon, proposed the venue.An official British source sought to lower expectations. “There will be no outcome from the meeting. No statement. No declaration. It’s a standard working meeting.” The timing of the meeting is nonetheless significant. Negotiations between the EU and Britain are scheduled to resume on August 13th. Raab met with the EU’s negotiator  for the first time in Brussels on July 19th, after Raab replaced  as Brexit secretary. Two important dates are looming: an informal meeting of EU heads of state and government in Salzburg on September 20th, and the October 18th , when the EU and UK are supposed to finalise a divorce agreement.Macron is unlikely to make concessions to May on Friday evening. At a time when the French leader is struggling to foster greater cohesion among Europeans, the fact that in two years none of the remaining 27 EU members has broken ranks on Brexit is a source of satisfaction in Paris. Britain has made overtures to individual capitals, but the French have constantly maintained that Barnier is the sole negotiator. “I imagine Macron will tell Theresa May ‘we will be as constructive as we can, but Monsieur Barnier will tell you our position’,” said a European diplomat in Paris.“The French are certainly not going to undermine a French negotiator,” the diplomat continued. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the EU Commission, will leave office after the May 2019 EU elections. “If Barnier succeeds in the Brexit negotiations, he will be a strong candidate to replace Juncker,” the diplomat said.British relations with Barnier have been tense. In an interview with the on the eve of his trip to Paris, Hunt said that “the probability of no deal is increasing by the day until we see a change of approach from the , who have this view that they just need to wait and Britain will blink”.The most difficult issue to resolve after the Irish Border is how to reconcile the indivisibility of the four freedoms of the single market – free movement of goods, services, capital and people – with Britain’s desire for free movement of goods alone in a post-Brexit relationship. The modalities of the UK’s departure are the top priority for the EU, while post-agreement arrangements are a greater priority for Britain. British officials warn of disruption to EU economies if a deal cannot be reached. , director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, told that 1.2 million jobs could be lost in the EU.“The UK has decided to reverse 46 years of economic integration and thought it would be easy,” the diplomat said. “The only concession that the French or  can make will be window-dressing, to preserve British dignity, not to humiliate them.” Subscribe.

<doc url="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/macron-is-left-reeling-after-summer-of-scandals-1.3606841" titre = "Macron is left reeling after summer of scandals" date = "Sat, Aug 25, 2018, 05:01">    Predictions that French president Emmanuel Macron would back down when he reformed the labour code and the SNCF railway system proved false. Photograph: Charles Platiau/ReutersBefore he left his summer residence at the Fort de Brégançon for Paris, after a three-week break, French president  mingled with a crowd of well-wishers. “Don’t think for a second that I will slow down or change course,” he promised them.The summer has not been easy for Macron. A scandal over the misconduct of his former head of security, , who beat up protesters at a May Day rally, was seized upon by the opposition to discredit Macron. The construction of a swimming pool at Bregançon, and Brigitte Macron’s selection of new china, also came under fire.The “Benalla affair” is one of four scandals ticking away in Macron’s immediate circle. This week, the  satirical weekly revealed that prior to taking office, culture minister Françoise Nyssen enlarged the offices of her publishing company by building 150sq m of mezzanines in a listed 18th century building, without seeking planning permission or paying additional property tax. Protecting heritage sites is part of Nyssen’s brief as culture minister.In addition to the Benalla and Nyssen scandals, the secretary general of the Élysée, , is under fire for alleged favouritism and conflict of interest. As a high-ranking official, Kohler had approved public contracts for a shipbuilding company owned by his mother’s cousins.The labour minister Muriel Pénicaud is also the subject of an inquiry, for having awarded a contract to organise a trip to Las Vegas by Macron when he was economy minister without a bidding process.Another challenge facing Macron is the fact that French growth was the slowest in the euro zone during the first half of 2018. The government had counted on 2 per cent growth this year, but economists say it will be closer to 1.7 per cent. Inflation is rising and 58 per cent of respondents in an Elabe poll published on Wednesday said government policies were causing their personal situations to worsen.Macron’s response to these difficulties is to plough ahead. He has created what the economic daily  calls “a gigantic traffic jam” of reforms to be negotiated and enacted from September. His administration is engaged in a high-wire balancing act between conservative and left-leaning factions of his centrist constituency. Conservatives criticise what they see as government profligacy, while leftists still see Macron as the “president of the rich”.Reforms slated for this autumn and winter are likely to strengthen Macron’s liberal, not social, credentials. He intends to boil France’s 42 retirement regimes down to a single set of rules based on points earned. It is in effect a nationwide shift from defined benefits to defined contributions. “Every euro contributed will give rise to the same rights,” Macron says., the secretary general of Force Ouvrière (Workers’ Force) trade union lashed out at the pension reform on  Inter radio this week, saying it was “the end of solidarity” and that “no one will ever be able to retire” because “whether you are 65, 70 or 75, you’ll never have enough points to be able to stop working”.France combines a 9.1 per cent jobless rate with labour shortages in certain sectors. Macron wants to revisit the amount of unemployment compensation, the length of eligibility and incentives to find work.Predictions that Macron would back down when he reformed the labour code and the SNCF railway system proved false. Pensions and unemployment insurance are equally explosive issues, but Macron has the advantage of building on previous victories.After repeated postponements, Macron’s “poverty plan” has been scheduled for presentation in mid-September. Statements by the ministers of the economy and the budget, and a video posted by the Élysée in which Macron said “We pour a crazy amount of dough into social welfare, and people are still poor,” give a taste of things to come. No matter how much money the government redistributes, it is “always insufficient”, Macron added subsequently, saying he preferred to “attack the roots of inequality”.A reform of the hospital system, the move to withhold income tax at source and an institutional reform to dramatically reduce the number of parliamentarians are also on Macron’s autumn agenda.The institutional reform had to be postponed because of the Benalla affair. Macron’s supporters accuse the opposition of turning a silly season news story into an affair of state. “Because they don’t have any ideas, they compared the excesses of a little yobbo with the Élysée wire-tapping scandal [under François Mitterrand] or even Watergate,” said  newspaper.Investigators are still waiting to question Benalla’s fiancée, Myriam, who reportedly removed a safe from the couple’s apartment the day after the scandal broke. The couple were forced to postpone their wedding when Benalla was detained by police.None of these scandals threaten to drive Macron out of office, but they have dented his promises of “exemplary probity” and increased disillusionment with the political class. Subscribe.

<doc url="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/macron-dealt-big-blow-as-ecology-minister-quits-on-live-radio-1.3610602" titre = "Macron dealt big blow as ecology minister quits on live radio" date = "Tue, Aug 28, 2018, 18:36">    Outgoing French minister for ecology Nicolas Hulot: “I do not want to give the illusion that my presence in the government signifies we are up to the challenge.” Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty ImagesPresident  has again been plunged into political crisis, this time by the on-air resignation of the most popular member of his cabinet, ecology minister . Hulot made the shock announcement on  Inter radio’s breakfast programme on Tuesday morning, with no advance warning to Macron or prime minister . “I know it’s not protocol,” Hulot said. “If I had told them beforehand, they might have tried to dissuade me, yet again.”Hulot (63) became known to virtually all of France when he launched the nature and adventure television programme 20 years ago. He refused to head the environment ministry under two previous French presidents and was considered a great “catch” by Macron.When US president  withdrew from the Paris climate accord last year, Macron coined the slogan “Make our planet great again.” Last December, the French president held the “One Planet Summit” to continue the work of the conference that drew up those accords. Hulot’s departure on ethical grounds leaves a gaping hole in Macron’s credentials as a defender of the environment.Hulot was the third-ranking cabinet minister, after the prime minister and the minister of the interior. Philippe said he would suggest names of possible replacements to Macron “in coming days”.During the summer heatwave, Hulot regretted that “one minister on his own” cannot solve global warming. It would take a “sacred union”, he said.As if to drive home Hulot’s point, announced on Tuesday that 2018 has been the second-hottest year on record, after 2003.In the interview in which he announced his resignation, Hulot said the “tragedy foretold” of global warming continues amid general indifference. “The planet is becoming an oven. Our natural resources are being exhausted. Biodiversity is melting like snow in the sun. And we are reviving the economic model that is the cause of all these disorders.”To save the planet, it would be necessary “to take control of the economy and finance” whereas “attempts to reconcile laissez-faireand ecology”, said , the director of newspaper.Hulot has been the Macron administration’s ecological alibi. He repeatedly threatened to resign, and Macron has described him as “never satisfied”.“To be or not to be a minister?” Joffrin wrote. “Like a Hamlet of politics, Hulot asked himself the question every morning.”The former conservative ecology minister  said Hulot “didn’t seem to have strong enough nerves to be a minister”. When he joined the government, she said, “He left the land of teddy bears for the lions’ den.”Hulot listed what he sees as the failures of his 15 months in office. “Have we begun to reduce our greenhouse emissions? No. Have we begun reducing the use of pesticides? No. Or stopping the erosion of biodiversity? No.”Hulot saw his role as one of damage limitation, but ultimately felt he could no longer condone government policies. He called the decision “the most difficult of my life” and added, “I no longer want to lie to myself. I do not want to give the illusion that my presence in the government signifies we are up to the challenge.”Perhaps the greatest humiliation to Hulot was being forced to announce last November that France was abandoning plans to reduce the amount of nuclear power in the country’s energy mix to 50 per cent by 2025. France currently derives three-quarters of its electricity from nuclear plants.The nuclear goal was made official in 2015, under François Hollande. Macron had promised to respect it. Hulot alluded on Tuesday to “this useless folly” of nuclear energy, regretting that he had been “unable to convince” Macron.Hulot also lost a battle with the agriculture ministry to outlaw the herbicide glyphosate, made by  and known by the commercial name Roundup.But it was the power of the hunting lobby that pushed Hulot over the edge. He recounted on France Inter having been surprised to find , the lobbyist for the national federation of hunters, at a meeting at the Élysée on Monday evening, where Macron decided to half the €400 annual licence fee for hunters.The federation says the move will “democratise” hunting as a “leisure activity.” There are 1.2 million hunters in France, split evenly politically between left and right.Hulot called the presence of Coste at the meeting “symptomatic of the presence of lobbyists in the circles of power”.“The hunting, nuclear and pesticide lobbies have all won battles against Nicolas Hulot,” said the green MEP . The hunters did not hide their glee at having shot down Hulot. “He spent 30 years dumping on hunters and fishermen,” said , president of the national federation of hunters. “As far as I’m concerned, this isn’t the worst news this week.” Subscribe.

Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty Images has been attacked by political opponents for describing French people as “Gauls who are resistant to change” during a trip to . In , the pro-business French president repeated his habit of using trips abroad to make deliberately headline-grabbing comments about how French people back home tend to be stuck in their ways.Addressing a gathering of expats, the 40-year-old centrist first expressed admiration for Denmark’s economic model before lamenting France’s resistance to it.The Nordic system – which combines the welfare state with a flexible labour market where it is easy to hire and fire – has in part inspired Mr Macron’s loosening of French labour laws and his controversial planned overhaul of French unemployment benefits.But the French president then said cultural differences between the “Lutheran” Danes and the French “Gauls” made it difficult to adopt the Nordic system in . “Let’s not be naive, what is possible is linked to a culture, to a people who are the product of their history,” he said. “These Lutheran people, who have experienced transformations in recent years, are not like the Gauls who are resistant to change,” he said, using a term for the ancient tribes that roamed France more than 2,000 years ago.The far-right , who was defeated by Mr Macron in last year’s presidential election and is attempting to challenge him in the European elections next spring, called him “arrogant”. The traditional rightwing party Les Républicains said he was insulting “French identity” and that France was proud of its obstinate cartoon character Gauls: Asterix and Obelix.The hard-left France Unbowed party said Macron was showing “disdain” to the French people. Trade unionists warned that the implication was that Gauls were mere commoners, beneath the kings.Mr Macron shot back that he had been “humorous” and stood by his comments on changing France. He told reporters: “I love France, I love our people and I think what our neighbours, partners and friends want to see is a France that is proud of itself and knows how to look hard at itself and history and the transformations under way.”He added: “It’s not contemptuous to tell the truth. We are not a country with a culture of consensus, of adjustments little by little.”Mr Macron has often used foreign trips to lament France’s resistance to reform. In  last year he sparked controversy over his use of the term “slackers” when he blasted what he deemed lazy, cynical and extreme opponents to change in France.But some observers saw Mr Macron’s comments in Copenhagen as a bid to turn the spotlight back onto economic policy and his programme for European reform in the face of dipping poll ratings, slower growth predictions, stubborn unemployment and cabinet troubles at home.This week, Mr Macron suffered a blow when his popular environment minister  suddenly quit government, saying the young president was not doing enough to counter climate change. He attacked Macron for being in thrall to powerful business and industry lobbies and interest groups. This was damaging as the French president had styled himself as “making the planet great again” to counter Donald Trump’s decision to remove the US from the Paris climate accords.Mr Macron – a political newcomer who, when he came to power last year, promised to break away from the establishment cronyism of the past – also came under fire for appointing his close personal friend, the French novelist , to the plum post of consul general for France in . Mr Besson is close to Macron and his wife Brigitte and wrote an overwhelmingly positive book on how Macron won the presidency in May 2017.“There is no cronyism in exchange for favours,” Mr Macron told reporters after the appointment, saying he wanted “to open up all of the top state jobs to people with talent and strengths from all walks of life”. – Guardian Subscribe.

It has been reported that Germany’s domestic intelligence agency may place the AfD  under full surveillance, sparking shockwaves in an election year. File photograph: John MacDougall/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Alternative für Deutschland’s (AfD) far-right wing is a potential risk for Germany’s constitutional order, according to domestic intelligence, because of its “overbearing” obsession with German identity.The federal constitutional protection office (BfV) has placed the eastern German wing of the far-right party under observation, and may expand this operation to the entire party, after a 436-page preliminary report raised concerns about its exclusionary, “racist and ethnocultural” ideas.The AfD is the third-largest party in the Bundestag, with 94 seats. In nearly 1,000 footnotes, the report cites examples of AfD obsessions with “Germanness”, such as a speech by a far-right figure at a far-right gathering last June.“Each of our thoughts, each word, our entire world view is German,” said AfD politician Hans-Thomas Tillschneider, quoted in the report. “There is a German understanding of family, a German way to dress. There is a German way to work, a German way to cook, a German way to build, a German way to make music and this way distinguishes us from other peoples.”This prescriptive AfD approach as to how “real” Germans should live, the BfV warned, was problematic because it risked the “exclusion and down-grading of people that do not meet these conditions”.In the preliminary report, the BfV points out how the AfD, founded as an anti-euro party but flourishing as an anti-immigration grouping, criticises German parliamentary status quo but recognises the democratic order.However, an eastern grouping named “Flügel” – meaning “Wing” – and the Junge Alternative (JA), the party’s radical youth wing, pose a challenge to the guarantee of human dignity laid down in article one of Germany’s post-war constitution or “Basic Law”.The report insists this does not forbid even polemical discussion about the real or imagined criminality of foreign nationals, attacks against their perceived lack of integration into German society or even swipes at the content anyone’s religious beliefs or world view – “once the person themselves is not devalued”.But the BfV identifies lines the AfD crosses, such as “when a certain population group, for example Muslims . . . are presented as having a nature that is presented as criminal, aggressive, instinct-driven and dangerous”.Another is a demand for “complete alignment with the average German”. Björn Höcke, head of the AfD in the eastern state of Thuringia, regularly crosses these lines and, with 50 pages and 608 references, is the star of the report.“These people that want to become Germans, we don’t demand that they integrate, naturally we demand that they assimilate,” he said in the eastern city of Erfurt in October 2016.The BfV suggests that this and other remarks – attacking the construction of mosques in Germany or describing the birth rate of Muslims in German as a “jihad” – as violating the Basic Law.This report is a further stage towards full state surveillance of AfD leaders and communications. Given how the Nazis – and East Germany – used the state apparatus to terrorise and outlaw political opponents, however, post-war Germany has high legal hurdles for open and undercover surveillance of any grouping. Even higher hurdles exist before the courts will agree to ban. Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

It is due for completion by the end of 2019 – when Ukraine’s current gas contract with Russia expires – and could deprive Kiev of billions of euro in transit fees and allow Moscow to cut fuel supplies to central and eastern , as it has done in previous years during political disputes.Ukraine and several EU states have denounced Nord Stream 2 and the  last month called for the pipeline to be halted “as it is a political project that poses a threat to European energy security”. Russia accounts for about 40 per cent of EU natural gas imports.European critics of the €9.5 billion scheme have found an ally in the , which wants Germany to scrap the plan and threatens to sanction European firms that are partners in the pipeline or help build it.US president  observed with incredulity last year that while the West was imposing economic sanctions on Russia for its aggression in Ukraine, Germany was backing an energy deal that would make it “captive” to Moscow.Kremlin-controlled  is leading the project, in partnership with German, Anglo-Dutch, French and Austrian companies, and Swiss and Italian firms are helping lay the pipeline.The US envoy to Berlin, , warned German businesses this month that they could face sanctions if they took part in Nord Stream 2.After talks in Moscow last Friday, German foreign minister  said “questions of European energy policy must be decided in Europe, not in the US . . . To impose unilateral sanctions against Nord Stream 2 is certainly not the way to go.”Moscow and some German politicians accuse Washington of using the issue to secure more of the European energy market for US firms, but their liquefied natural gas supplies to Europe remain more expensive than deliveries from Russia.German chancellor  insists Nord Stream 2 is an economic, not political, venture, but during talks with Russian president  last year she said: “Ukraine should retain its role as a transit nation after Nord Stream 2 is completed . . . This is a matter of strategic significance.”Mr Putin said last week there were still “possibilities” for Ukraine to act as a transit country in future, alongside Nord Stream 2 and the Turk Stream pipeline now being built to deliver Russian gas to , the Balkans and central Europe. Subscribe.

But Morocco is stressing there could have been many more.During the summer, it launched a crackdown on immigrants trying to sneak into Spain and says it has foiled 70,000 attempted illegal crossings.Morocco’s efforts highlight an important new front in Europe’s attempt to staunch migration: moves to work with countries outside the continent to stop migrants before they arrive on Europe’s shores.Its crackdown has involved rounding up thousands of migrants to bus them to southern Morocco, where some have been abandoned in remote areas, according to reports cited by . The group has described the moves as “cruel and unlawful” and denounced “particularly violent raids” on informal settlements occupied by migrants.Amnesty has also criticised Spain for expelling 116 migrants back to Morocco the day after they arrived in Ceuta without adequate screening for genuine asylum seekers.For the north African country’s leaders, angst over migration in Europe gives them some leverage. In Spain, where African migration is a source of growing unease, officials have promised that Madrid will be Morocco’s “voice” in the EU.Haizam Amirah-Fernandez, senior analyst at the , a Madrid think tank, said: “Part of the Spanish reaction to the rise in numbers is to try to get support from Europe for Morocco in different forms such as economic aid, materiel for control of immigration plus broader political support.”In his first official meeting with Morocco’s king and prime minister in November, Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez stressed that Morocco itself was “suffering” from migratory flows. “The EU has to, in a structural way, offer economic resources for Morocco,” he said.He emphasised their countries’ “total harmony” in their approach to migrant returns, but said co-operation would be “strengthened” after reports that Morocco had cut the number of irregular Moroccan migrants it would let Spain send back without due legal process.The Spanish mainland is easily visible from Ceuta and the shores of northern Morocco and the lights of Andalucían cities such as  beckon to migrants who have endured often-horrific hardships crossing the Sahara.Migration through Morocco shot up as the route to Europe via  became more dangerous, with  cracking down on rescue ships and making deals with the Libyan coast guard to stem departures.The migrants who try to storm the walls of Ceuta and , another Spanish enclave, often capture more public attention, but the vast majority head directly for the Spanish mainland on board smugglers’ boats that cross the narrow Strait of .Last year, more than 60,000 Mediterranean migrants arrived in Spain, including Ceuta and Melilla, surpassing the combined total of migrants who have arrived in  and Italy. However, the overall number of Mediterranean arrivals of 117,540, as of mid-December, is barely one-tenth of the 2015 high of more than a million.In the Moroccan port of Tangiers, where African migrants could be seen begging or labouring in markets earlier last year, the crackdown has forced many into hiding.Yahya, a Senegalese, who has been in Morocco for seven months, said he was bussed to  900km to the south after police raided the home he shared with other migrants.“I begged to collect the bus fare and returned,” said Yahya, who has tried five times to reach Spain. He says migrants receive food from Moroccan families and live in fear of undercover police. “We can only move in the evenings to avoid arrest,” he says., Morocco’s border control chief, told al-Jazeera television in December that allegations of human rights violations against the migrants were baseless. “What we are doing is according to our laws,” he said. “We encourage migrants to settle in Morocco but we can’t allow illegal behaviour.”Morocco has given residence papers to some 50,000 migrants since 2014, but most of the young Africans who arrive in the kingdom have no interest in settling there.The Moroccan crackdown, which some say has started to abate, is the harshest since 2013, according to , a lawyer in Tangiers who represents migrants. But he said there has historically been “an ebb and flow” in anti-migrant campaigns.“Sometimes they step up their campaigns and sometimes they look the other way and allow migration to happen as a form of pressure on Europe,” he said.Amirah-Fernandez said: “There is the suspicion that migration control is used to convey a message to Spain or to Europe when there is neighbourhood friction over an issue important to Morocco.”Back in Ceuta, Keita, the Guinean migrant, is waiting for the government to move him to mainland Spain and his new life in Europe. But many in the enclave – including Algerians and Moroccans – face expulsion back to their home countries if they cannot persuade the European authorities to grant them refuge on grounds such as the risk of political persecution.By the harbour in Ceuta, Fathi Berrached, a 23-year-old Algerian, waits for a chance to steal on to a ferry to make the half-hour crossing to Spain. “You swim to the ferry and climb on the engine, but if they spot you first, they push you back,” he says. “Nothing will stop me.

It was the beginning of French politics as we know it.The maverick writer and future culture minister André Malraux orchestrated a showy ceremony on the Place de la République, replete with streamers, flags and flowers. Malraux had a 40-metre high “V” erected behind the statue at the centre of the square, symbolising the Roman numeral “five” but also the “V” of victory.At the appointed time, de Gaulle pulled up in a black Citroën. He moved his ungainly, six-foot, three-inch frame slowly up the steps to the platform, paused and raised his arms in the “V” sign.  Three-thousand policemen, armed with truncheons and tear gas cannisters, were deployed in blue vans around the square to counter left-wing protesters. In a ritual repeated countless times since, 10 demonstrators and six riot policemen ended up in hospital. Eighty-seven people were arrested.At the liberation of Paris 12 years earlier, de Gaulle had convinced the French that the US-led allied victory was theirs, that had, like him, resisted Nazi occupation.Disgusted by postwar political squabbling, de Gaulle went home to Colombey-les-Deux-Églises and sulked for 12 years. The parliamentary system fostered chronic instability, with governments changing every six months. The war in  almost brought civil war to metropolitan France.In the spring of 1958, General  hatched “Operation Resurrection” to bring de Gaulle back to power. Civilian authorities welcomed him as a saviour. If they hadn’t, Massu was planning a coup on behalf of de Gaulle. At a press conference in May, de Gaulle asked “Why should I, at the age of 67, begin a career as a dictator?”De Gaulle endowed France with nuclear weapons, a belief in French universalism and , and a seat at the UN . He was lucid about the difficulty of governing such an unruly people. “How can you govern a country that has 246 varieties of cheese?” he famously quipped.Though de Gaulle is now regarded as the greatest Frenchman of the 20th century, the left long considered him a dictator. In 1965, the socialist politician François Mitterrand published a book about de Gaulle titled .  De Gaulle asked his most faithful lieutenant, Michel Debré, to draw up the constitution. “I was trying to create a synthesis between monarchy and republic,” de Gaulle was later quoted as saying. Not unlike Emmanuel Macron’s .The constitutional expert  coined the phrase “republican monarchy” to describe the presidential office created by and for de Gaulle. The French president appoints ministers and presides over cabinet meetings, chooses all civil and military officials, and is commander-in-chief of the armed forces. He has the right to rule by decree and can suspend the constitution altogether in the event of a national emergency.  The ceremony on the Place de la République launched the campaign for a referendum on the new constitution. It passed by a stunning 80 per cent majority on September 28th. De Gaulle was inaugurated as the first president of the Fifth Republic the following January. But the May ’68 revolution was clearly a rejection of de Gaulle’s authoritarianism. He left office the following year, after losing a referendum on institutional reform.Presidential candidates, from Jean-Marie Le Pen on the far right to Jean-Luc Mélenchon on the far left, promised to move to a more democratic Sixth Republic if elected. But if they ever reached office, they would doubtless have learned to love de Gaulle’s constitution. After being de Gaulle’s fiercest opponent, Mitterrand was so monarchical during his 1981–1995 rule that humorists referred to him as .and are the criticisms most often levelled at Macron. Since his solemn walk across the courtyard of the Louvre on the night of his election, to Macron’s use of châteaux at Versailles and Chambord, “Jupiter” too wields the symbols of monarchy.De Gaulle wrote the script for French leaders’ solitary exercise of power. When he appointed himself leader of the  in 1940, de Gaulle said he felt “alone and without protection, like a man at the edge of an ocean saying he will swim across it”.Being president is always an honour, sometimes a privilege, Macron told a class full of 11-year-olds when he visited a school with the minister of education on Monday.“Some days are easy. Others are not.” Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty Images finally reacted this week to an alleged Iranian plot to bomb a rally by an opposition group outside Paris, more than three months after the plot was foiled.Two close associates of US president  – his lawyer  and , the former Republican speaker of the House – attended the rally.Although the failed attack created tension between Paris and Tehran, and despite the fact that Paris this week imposed limited sanctions, President  still hopes to salvage the 2015 nuclear accord with  and has adopted a more nuanced approach than Washington to Iranian actions.On October 2nd, the French ministries of foreign affairs, finance and the interior announced they were freezing the assets of the directorate of interior security, a unit of the , Etala’at.France is also freezing the assets of , an Iranian arrested in  in July. Asadi enjoyed diplomatic status in  and was, according to Bavarian authorities, responsible for the surveillance of Iran’s adversaries in . He allegedly provided 500 grammes of TATP explosives to a Belgian-Iranian couple: Amir S (38), a former employee at the port of Rotterdam, and his wife (33).Germany is extraditing Asadi to , where he will be prosecuted with the couple. A fourth suspect, who has not been identified, was arrested in France and turned over to Belgian authorities.France is also freezing the assets of , whom it accuses of having planned the attack against the Mujaheddeen el Khalq (MEK), also known as the National Council of Resistance of Iran.The MEK participated in the Iranian revolution, then turned against the regime, staging many attacks in Tehran. It is often likened to an Islamo-Marxist cult, and supported  during the 1980-1988 Gulf war. The US listed the MEK as a terrorist group from 1997 until 2012.Trump’s national security adviser, , and other US neo-conservatives have supported the MEK in its drive for “regime change” in Iran. Trump acolytes Giuliani and Gingrich were among 25,000 people attending the June 30th rally which was to have been attacked at the Villepinte convention centre between Paris and Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport., spokesman for the Iranian foreign ministry, denied the plot, calling it “a misunderstanding about a thing that does not exist, whether it’s a conspiracy perpetrated by others or an error, we [and the French] can sit down and talk about it.”French officials said it took three months to complete the investigation which “shows without doubt the responsibility of Iranian intelligence in the planned attack”. Neither Asadi nor Moghadam hold assets in France, according to the . The sanctions are for six months duration, so the measure is symbolic. It is not known whether the intelligence ministry has assets in France.By contrast, since last May, when it unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear accord, the Trump administration has begun reimposing sanctions against all sectors of the Iranian economy, including the central bank, financial institutions, air and sea transport and the hydrocarbons industry. Washington also threatened to punish any foreign company that does business with Iran. The first raft of US sanctions entered into force on August 6th. The second round will take effect on November 4th.Tehran welcomed a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 3rd condemning US sanctions against medical equipment, food and agricultural products, spare parts and services linked to civil aviation. John Bolton accused ICJ judges of facilitating Iranian “propaganda”. The ICJ cannot force the US to respect its decision.On October 2nd, the same day sanctions were imposed on the two individuals and the unit of the intelligence ministry, French police raided the Shia Muslim Zahra Centre, considered an outlet for Iran and the Lebanese Shia group , in Grande-Synthe, a suburb of Dunkirk.The raids on the centre and its leaders’ homes were meant to be a further signal to Tehran. Three people were held for illegal possession of weapons, including , an Algerian-born convert to Shia Islam and a former halal butcher in his 60s.Gouasmi supported the Anti-Zionist Party PAS, founded by the comedian Dieudonné and , both notorious anti-Semites. Gouasmi accompanied Dieudonné to Iran in 2009, when they met then president . The group fragmented in 2014, amid mutual accusations of misuse of Iranian funds.French officials say they will not allow Iran to revert to its 1980s habit of assassinating opponents on French territory. But they see the plot as the result of the power struggle between Iranian moderates and hardliners, intended to discredit President  when he was in Europe to shore up support for salvaging the nuclear agreement. Unlike Washington, Paris believes it is possible to exert pressure on Iran while maintaining dialogue. Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

File photograph: Charles Platiau/ReutersThe UN  said on Tuesday that France’s ban on the niqab, the full-face Islamic veil, was a violation of human rights and called on it to review the legislation. had failed to make the case for its ban, the committee said, as it gave Paris 180 days to report back on what actions it had taken on the issue.“In particular, the committee was not persuaded by France’s claim that a ban on face covering was necessary and proportionate from a security standpoint or for attaining the goal of ‘living together’ in society,” it said.The UN panel of 18 independent experts oversees compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Implementation of its decisions is not mandatory, but under an optional protocol of the treaty, France has an international legal obligation to comply “in good faith”.A French foreign ministry spokesman said the law was legitimate, necessary and respected religious freedom. The ban applies to hiding one’s face, not to any type of religious clothing that leaves the face uncovered, he told reporters.The spokesman also pointed out that both France’s constitutional court and the European Court of Human Rights, whose rulings are binding, had upheld the full-face veil ban, saying it did not violate religious freedom.The UN Human Rights Committee disagreed with this in its statement on Tuesday, saying the ban disproportionately harmed the right of women to manifest their religious beliefs and could lead to them being confined at home and marginalised.The committee’s findings follow complaints by two French women convicted in 2012 under a 2010 law stipulating that “no one may, in a public space, wear any article of clothing intended to conceal the face”.In its findings, the panel called on France to pay the two women compensation.Under the ban, anyone wearing the full-face veil in public is liable to a fine of €150 or lessons in French citizenship. According to Metronews media, 223 fines were handed out in 2015 for wearing a full veil in public.Other countries in  have also introduced legislation on Islamic dress. Denmark’s parliament enacted a ban on the wearing of face veils in public in May. , the ,  and the German state of Bavaria have also imposed some restrictions on full-face veils in public places.France has the largest Muslim minority in Europe, estimated at 5 million or more out of a population of 67 million. The UN Human Rights Committee came to similar conclusions on a 2008 case in which a woman was sacked by a creche for wearing a veil. In September, a top French judge was quoted by newspaper  as saying that while not binding, the panel’s decisions might still influence French case law. – Reuters Subscribe.

They were detained in swoops on addresses in the Isere region, southeast of Lyon, in Moselle on the border with Germany and Luxembourg, and in Ille-et-Vilaine near the city of Rennes in the country’s northwest.It was not immediately clear what the connection between those arrested was.In an interview published on Sunday, Mr Macron warned of the threat from far-right movements across Europe, saying complacency during the 1930s was what had opened the way for the rise of Hitler in Germany and Mussolini in Italy.In June, 10 people linked to France’s radical far right were placed under formal investigation on suspicion of links to terrorist networks.A source close to the investigation said the 10 belonged to a hardline group whose stated intent was to “fight against the threat of Islam” and were suspected of planning an attack on Muslims.The June raids led to the seizure of ingredients for making explosives as well as guns and ammunition. It was not clear if Tuesday’s security operation was connected to the June arrests. – Reuters Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

Photograph: Philippe WojazerFrench president  will travel to  on Sunday for a three-day visit that raises a thorny foreign policy question.Can a leader who professes to represent progressive forces in  compromise himself and his country by maintaining close relations with a dictator who represses his own people?Fifteen months ago, Macron gave Field Marshal  a red carpet welcome at the Élysée Palace.“I believe in the sovereignty of states. So in the same way that I do not accept other leaders giving me lessons on how to govern my country, I don’t lecture others,” Macron said when asked about massive human rights abuses in Egypt.Macron’s statement created outrage among human rights defenders. The question has grown more acute in the intervening period.And although  is not prepared to profoundly alter its friendship with the country of 100 million, there are signs of an inflection in Macron’s rhetoric, if not his policy.“The unprecedented repression of civil society in Egypt has intensified,” says , advocacy officer at the French chapter of . Roux was one of eight human rights defenders who met Macron’s top Middle-East advisers at the Élysée this week, to brief them on what Roux calls “the serious deterioration of the human rights situation since Sisi’s visit”.Conditions grew particularly bad in the run-up to the March 2018 Egyptian presidential election, Roux says.“Egyptian authorities have adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards any free and independent voices who are perceived to criticise the government. Sisi’s government has been intractable in hunting down all potential rivals.”The French branch of the Irish group  published a report on January 14th detailing the persecution of Egyptian labour activists. In particular, 26 civilian labourers at the Alexandria shipyard, where the French company  is carrying out a €1 billion contract, have been subjected to military trials.On January 23rd, Reporters Without Borders published portraits of 10 of the 32 journalists imprisoned by Sisi’s regime. Their offences include writing about run-away inflation, anti-terrorist operations and the corruption of senior officials.The repression “touches every milieu, every level of society”, Roux says. “Last May, 35 people were arrested for protesting peacefully against a hike in fuel costs. They were accused of holding an unauthorised demonstration, and of belonging to a terrorist group.”The government uses the accusation of “belonging to a terrorist group” arbitrarily and to an unprecedented extent, Roux says. “Prosecutors are instructed to detain anyone who criticises the government . . . 500 websites have been blocked . . . Human rights defenders are prosecuted as ‘internal enemies’ if they are receiving funding from abroad. Civil society has been locked down, muzzled. The reality is that Egypt violates human rights in total impunity. Egyptian society is suffocating.”Only this month, an Egyptian television presenter was sentenced to a year in prison because he interviewed a homosexual on his programme, despite having said he opposed homosexuality.Meanwhile, the Egyptian prime minister  announced that Sisi has ordered that all owners of red-brick buildings paint them in a single colour by specific deadlines or face prosecution. Unpainted red-brick facades are “uncivilised”, Madbouly said.In an ornate briefing room at the Élysée Palace, advisers to Macron emphasised the “unavoidable” necessity of maintaining good relations with Cairo.Because of Egypt’s size, history and geography, it plays an important role in civil wars in  and , and in the Gaza Strip. It is also crucial in fighting terrorism and illegal immigration.The human rights groups supplied the Élysée with a list of 30 journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders whose cases they want Macron to raise with Sisi. Human rights abuses “will be raised, including publicly by the president of the republic” in Cairo, one of Macron’s advisers promised.We will not know until a joint press conference in Sisi’s palace on Monday how forcefully Macron will make his point, but the commitment is a change from Macron’s tart refusal to “lecture” Sisi in 2017.The Élysée “has been giving us the argument about silent diplomacy for too long”, says Roux. “There’s a consensus that it didn’t work. We’re asking for strong, public denunciation.”Human rights groups are also asking that France stall arms sales to Egypt. French armoured vehicles were “hijacked” from the army to the police, who used them for suppressing demonstrations.Now Egypt wants to buy armed drones and other surveillance equipment which could be used against domestic opposition. Macron’s advisers promise France will be more vigilant in future.Demands by human rights defenders are less likely to affect big ticket items such as Rafale fighter aircraft and Mistral helicopter carriers.“France cannot continue to sell weapons to Egypt, to make itself an accomplice of repression, while claiming that it’s addressing human rights,” Roux concludes. Subscribe.

Photograph:  BSPP - Brigade de sapeurs-pompiers de Paris/AFPA 40-year-old woman has been transferred from police custody to the psychiatric unit at the Paris prefecture, after being arrested on suspicion of setting fire to the Paris building she inhabited early on Tuesday morning. Ten of her neighbours died in the fire, and 30 other people, including eight firemen, were injured. At least one of the fatalities was a small child.The suspect was recently released from psychiatric hospital, and had argued with one of her neighbours, a fireman by profession. Police visited the building to calm the dispute. Ten minutes after they left, the woman reportedly used inflammable material to start fires on several floors. She was apprehended in the street below, trying to set fire to a car and rubbish bins. Police said she was inebriated.Clément Eschenlohr was an eye witness to the fire. On the pavement outside his lycée a few hours later, the 17 year-old was still visibly shaken. Fellow students crowded around him, speaking animatedly, many of them smoking.Clément lives on the second floor opposite the building that burned at 17 bis rue Erlanger. Notre Dame des Oiseaux school, where he is enrolled, is adjacent to the scene of the disaster.“My mother woke me around 1am,” Clément recounted. “She said, ‘There’s a fire. We have to get out’.” They went downstairs to the foyer, where other neighbours had also taken refuge.“A woman was sobbing because her daughter was on the eighth floor next door. I think she didn’t get out,” Clément continued. “I went back up to our apartment several times. I saw bodies. I saw a man fall from the fifth floor balcony… I try not to think about it, but I see flames in front of me all the time. I see my neighbours crouched on their balconies and screaming for help. They were only five metres away. We closed the metal shutters, because we were afraid their building would explode, and we wanted to save our apartment.”Clément and his friends then went into the school courtyard, which reeked of smoke. The façade of the gutted building rose up behind the school, its roof charred.  A pair of red and white striped leggings hung from a railing.A dozen residents had waited on the roof for firemen to reach them with ladders. One hundred and twenty residents were evacuated from 80 apartments. Authorities fear they may find more bodies.The rue Erlanger is on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne. The former president Nicolas Sarkozy and the billionaire Vincent Bolloré live in a private lane nearby. It is never a friendly, outgoing area, but on Tuesday it was in mourning. No one smiled. Residents gathered in small groups. Three fire engines were parked at the police line, alongside the television cameras.Four 16-year-olds whiled away their free period. “We checked all the school records, elementary, college and lycée,” said a tall young man called Nicolas. “Our students were lucky. Not one of them lived in that building.”It took 200 firemen from 1am until 6am to control the fire. When students arrived for class at 8am, the entry via the rue Erlanger was shut, so they used the entrance in the rue Michel Ange instead. The gutters overflowed with water from fire hoses. Teachers told them not to open the windows, to keep the smoke out, and asked them to pray.There was a degree of comfort in knowing that the fire was the doing of an unhinged woman, not the result of a building flaw, a student called Chloé told me. Her neighbourhood was not dangerous like the rue d’Aubagne in Marseille, where a tenement collapsed in November, killing eight people.A pretty blonde called Marie looked particularly sad. “You see that burned building, and you think, ‘It could have been me’,” she said, echoing a sentiment repeatedly heard from others . “When those people went to bed last night, everything was normal. Death can come at any moment.”Two ageing Lebanese women in furs and a man in a track suit, all neighbours in the rue Chanez, parallel to the rue Erlanger, stood talking. Though the fire was just a few hundred metres from them, the women learned of it when friends called from abroad. The man’s wife read the news on the internet.Like the lycée students, the neighbours compared the shock to that of terrorist attacks in recent years. They’d felt insecure since police defused a bomb made from gas cannisters in their street last year, one of the Lebanese women said. “We’re on the lookout, all the time.”The fire made them think about their own building. “We have a strange neighbour too,” the man in the tracksuit volunteered. “It has nothing to do with the fire, but she’s involved in prostitution and the police have visited building. You never know what could happen…” Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

Long live Europe’" date = "Feb 23, 2019">When the French far-right leader  imploded in the last televised debate of the 2017 presidential election, many thought her political career was over.Le Pen says she suffered from a crippling ophthalmic migraine on the day she debated . The excuse didn’t change anything. Her financially bankrupt party was hounded by the  for misappropriation of EU funds. Its legacy of racism and anti-Semitism was so pungent that Le Pen changed the party’s name from  to “Rassemblement National”, also known as RN, or National Rally.The RN headquarters in a residential street in  is an hour by metro and bus from central Paris. A shabby statue of Joan of Arc, historic symbol of the Front founded by Le Pen’s father Jean-Marie, stands forlorn between the front door and the parking lot. St Joan looks like a rescue from a flea market, her gold paint weathering off.There is a chasm between the role the Le Pens have played in  and , and their exiguous means. In a 90-minute group interview last week with the Anglo-American Press Association in Paris, Marine Le Pen repeatedly and proudly called the RN “the leading opposition party”. But the RN’s headquarters,where the interview takes places, resembles a prefab office building in a former Eastern Bloc country.Internal feuds have prevented the  building up a cadre of educated, experienced officials. , the 23-year-old head of the RN list in next May’s European elections, “was born and raised in a bad neighbourhood”, Le Pen tells us. “He knows the daily problems of immigration, unemployment and sectarianism.”Le Pen has tried to make the country forget her father’s jokes about gas ovens, his comments about the Holocaust being a “detail” of history, and his praise for the second World War collaborationist leader Marshal Philippe Pétain. In her quest for respectability, she even expelled Jean-Marie from the party he founded.The daughter apparently believed that by discarding anti-Semitism but retaining anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric, she could win over large segments of the French electorate. She was not entirely wrong.Now the party’s history has returned to haunt Le Pen. On February 11th, France’s interior ministry announced a 74 per cent increase in anti-Semitic acts last year.This month alone, a tree planted in memory of , a Jewish youth who was kidnapped and tortured to death by a self-called “gang of barbarians”, was cut down.Someone daubed swastikas on Paris street art portraying the French stateswoman and Holocaust survivor . The philosopher , who is Jewish, was accosted in the street as a “dirty Zionist” by a man wearing the yellow vest of the  protesters.In the hours before a Paris protest march against anti-Semitism on February 19th, it emerged that a Jewish cemetery in  had been desecrated.An 80-year-old Jewish woman called  was murdered, allegedly by a Muslim neighbour, in Paris in March 2018. The Jewish organisation  had opposed Le Pen’s presence at a march in honour of Knoll. Le Pen went anyway, and was booed.Le Pen also threatened to sue Agnès Buzyn, the health minister, who accused her of being “two-faced” on the issue and “running to  or  with all the neo-Nazis every time she gets a chance”., the head of Macron’s LREM party, said the RN “was built on anti-Semitism, on fascism”.“I expelled from the FN everyone who was even vaguely connected with racism or anti-Semitism,” Le Pen protests plaintively in our interview. “All the murders of our Jewish compatriots have been done by Islamic fundamentalists.”Le Pen admits the RN has welcomed former members of the , a far-right group who oppose immigration and Islam, and who first came to attention for occupying the construction site of the grand mosque in  in 2012. Like many RN members, the  believe Renaud Camus’s theory of the “great replacement” of the white European population by Arabs and Africans.“The  have never been banned or convicted for violence,” Le Pen says. “They’re being prosecuted for a banner against migrants. I’m sorry, but I don’t see what is reprehensible about that.”Le Pen seems so preoccupied by Europe, Macron and the  that she no longer launches into spontaneous tirades against radical Islam.“The threat is extremely grave in France, because radical Islam prospered here,” she says when I ask if Islamic State has been conquered. “It’s an octopus with tentacles everywhere, in the [immigrant] neighbourhoods, the associations, the sports clubs. They’re still financed from abroad, because no one has decided to eradicate radical Islam in this country.”For a long time, the Le Pens were on the fringes of Europe. Other far-right populists shunned them because of their sulphurous reputation. If Marine Le Pen is cheerful and punchy these days, it is because she has found fellow travellers.Last October, Le Pen travelled to Rome to see the Italian interior minister, head of the far-right Lega and Italian government strongman . A poster at RN headquarters shows Le Pen and Salvini side by side, before the French and Italian tricolours. “All over Europe, our ideas are coming to power,” it says.A poll conducted by the European Parliament this week concluded that Salvini’s party is likely to win 32 per cent of the Italian vote and 27 seats in the European assembly in May, giving the Lega the largest portion of the vote in  and making it the second-largest party in , after the German centre-right CDU.Salvini, Le Pen and the Polish Law and Justice party say they will join forces after the election.The success of populist right-wing parties has changed Le Pen’s strategy. She no longer wants a referendum on “Frexit”. She would rather undermine the EU from the inside.“We are no longer isolated at all on the European stage,” Le Pen says. “Like the Lega in Italy, or the Swedish Democrats [a far-right party that is now the third largest in Sweden], we can legitimately hope to change Europe from within . . . This path was opened to us by the rise of movements that defend the same ideas we do, some of whom are in government. That is the case in , Austria and Italy.“It is extremely encouraging for us. We can turn our backs on all that made European peoples suffer, on policies that led to the economic and social failure of the EU. I summarise it this way: the European Union is dead. Long live Europe.”Le Pen bears particular animus towards the , whose members are nominated by national governments. She wants to replace it with “a simple technical secretariat” that would serve the , as the heads of state and government are collectively known.“The commission has appropriated powers far beyond those attributed to it in the treaties,” Le Pen claims. “Particularly in matters of immigration. Why should the European Commission force a country to accept migrants, impose the conditions in which they are received, and determine the number of migrants? Where is that written, in what treaty?“One sees that the EU is adrift, that it has distanced itself from people, that it now works against people, after ignoring them in the past.”Le Pen maintains an ambiguous relationship with the  – or yellow vest – protesters, who have destabilised France over the past three months. On the one hand, she says she’s not sure who they are. But she insists that the riots and vandalism that have characterised the movement are the work of the far-left.“For years and years, every time a social movement has emerged the extreme left has infiltrated it and brought violence,” Le Pen says. She accuses the government of “giving [far-left vandals] the benefit of total impunity so as to destroy the credibility of the  movement”.Several  have attempted to constitute lists for the European elections, but each time they are attacked by their cohorts and give up. Polls indicate a  list could siphon votes from Le Pen’s party. Others expect her to invite yellow vests to join RN lists.Le Pen evades that question, but claims a form of parenthood over the movement. “It is the France of the forgotten, that I’ve been talking about for years, that has revolted,” she says. “When I said there was great suffering in the country, that many people could not live decently even though they were working, that it was unjust, that whole swathes of the country were abandoned, that the state did not care about them, I was foretelling this  movement.”Le Pen speaks most scathingly of Macron, her nemesis in the 2017 presidential election. She called on him at the Élysée on February 6th, as part of Macron’s consultations in the “great national debate” he has organised in the hope of ending the crisis.To hear Le Pen tell it, she read the riot act to Macron, telling him he must establish proportional representation, which would give the RN far more seats in the National Assembly, establish referendums by popular initiative, as Salvini and his populist allies have done in Italy, dissolve the legislature and hold new elections.“I told him that he cannot pretend to be a new and different president, that he cannot claim to represent a new world, if he reacts exactly like the old one.”At the end of January, Manlio Di Stefano, an undersecretary for foreign affairs and a member of the populist Five Star Movement which shares power in Italy, said Macron “suffers from small penis syndrome”.Le Pen claims she was unaware of the insult, but then turns the question around to attack Macron.“It seems to me that Macron fired the first shot, when he referred to the ‘populist leprosy’ of Italian, Polish and Hungarian leaders,” Le Pen says. “These insults obviously created tension which pushed some European leaders to raise their voices, including, and I regret it, unfortunate remarks about Emmanuel Macron.“During the [presidential] campaign, Macron’s supporters said it was him or chaos,” Le Pen continues. “Well, in 18 months he has brought total chaos to France. He has brought violence and division, and he’s sown chaos and division in Europe too. This man takes chaos everywhere he goes.”Macron and Le Pen both claim to have blown apart the traditional left-right divide in French politics. They use the same vocabulary, but with different meanings. Both talk about globalisation. He is for, she is against. And nationalism. He is against, she is for. And sovereignty. She wants to “reclaim” national sovereignty for France. He wants sovereignty for Europe. The French need protection, Le Pen says. Since the  crisis, Macron has talked more about the protective powers of Europe.France’s two-round, majority voting system deprives the RN of significant representation in domestic politics. But the then Front National won the last, single-round European elections five years ago, with nearly 25 per cent of the vote, four percentage points ahead of the runners-up, the conservatives who now call themselves Les Républicains.At the end of 2018, polls indicated that in May the RN would again win the European elections.But an Ifop poll published on February 20th confirmed Macron has reversed the situation, at least for the time being. His LREM party is now in the lead, at 24 per cent of the vote, to 20 per cent for Le Pen’s RN.Les Républicains are third at 10 per cent, the ecologists fourth at 9 per cent, and the far-left LFI has shrunk to 7.5 per cent.So Le Pen is not a spent force after all. By winning one-third of the presidential vote in 2017, and by confronting Macron in the European poll, she can credibly call herself the leader of the French opposition.She may be a flea market Joan of Arc, but it’s a role she relishes.

Photograph: Bertrand Guay/AFP/Getty ImagesA French gynaecologists’ union has threatened to stop carrying out abortions in an attempt to force France’s minister for health to meet disgruntled doctors.The Syngof union wrote to its 1,600 members telling them to be prepared to stop carrying out terminations to “make ourselves heard” and force the government’s hand.Syngof, which represents about one-quarter of France’s gynaecologists and obstetricians, published the letter as part of a protest over what it claims is a lack of insurance funds for colleagues convicted of medical errors.Minister for health Agnès Buzyn and feminist organisations said the threat was “unacceptable” and amounted to “taking women hostage”.In a statement, Ms Buzyn wrote: “In no case should taking women hostage in this way be used as a lever for negotiations or for media coverage of an issue the department is following very closely.”She said the threat went against the “unconditional respect for the right to abortion guaranteed in our country” and that she regretted the “distorted image” such statements gave of French gynaecologists and obstetricians, “from a union that is supposed to represent them”.The row erupted just months after Syngof’s president, Dr Bertrand de Rochambeau, justified his refusal to perform terminations by declaring that abortions amounted to “homicide”.In the letter sent this week, gynaecologists were urged to “be ready to stop carrying out terminations to make ourselves heard”.The French Order of Doctors condemned the threat, which it declared “totally contrary to medical ethics”.French equality minister Marlène Schiappa said it was “unacceptable blackmail”. “Everywhere in the world, women’s rights are threatened, sometimes by governments, sometimes by interest groups, non-governmental organisations, unions . . . the mere existence of these threats is shameful,” Ms Schiappa said.The joint president of the Family Planning Association, , said it was a “backwards step . . . but not entirely a surprise”. She said Syngof had a habit of “going too far in this way”.“This new incident shows us that even if the right to abortion is written in the law, it cannot yet be taken for granted,” Ms Rebhi said. – Guardian Subscribe.

File photograph: APAt least four people were injured when a man intentionally drove into a crowd of people in western Germany in what appears to have been an attack directed at foreigners, police have said.Muenster police said the 50-year-old driver of a Mercedes rammed into a crowd in the centre of Bottrop minutes into the new year.Two further attempts by the driver to run down other people failed.On the Berliner Platz he drove again into a group of people. At least four, including Syrian and Afghan nationals, were severely injured. Police confirmed that those struck by the car were in a serious condition.The driver fled towards the nearby city of Essen before being stopped and arrested by police.The suspect had also tried in Essen to drive his car into a group of people waiting at a bus stop on the Schlossstrasse.At his arrest the driver made xenophobic remarks, according to police. The investigative authorities are assuming a targeted attack at this point which may be a consequence of the driver’s xenophobic attitude. Moreover, investigating officers said there are indications the suspect is mentally ill and that the attack is presumed to have been premeditated.As the threat of terror increases throughout Europe and the world read the latest news, opinion and analysis as it happens here Subscribe.

Video: ReutersA still image taken from a video footage shows a rescuer carring a 10-month-old child found alive in the rubble of a Russian apartment block that partially collapsed after a suspected gas blast. Photograph: via  Reuters TV Russian emergency services have found an 11-month-old baby boy alive in the rubble of an apartment block that collapsed in a gas explosion, after a bitterly cold night in which temperatures dropped to -26 degrees.“Rescuers heard crying. The baby was saved by being in a cradle and warmly wrapped up,” regional governor  said.The infant, which was carefully pulled from the wreckage, was later driven to hospital.The health ministry said in a statement the child was in a dangerous condition with serious frostbite, a head injury and leg fractures. He was due to be taken to Moscow for treatment.The astonishing recovery - about 35 hours after the block collapsed - provided a dash of hope for rescuers, even as the search for other survivors looked increasingly futile.At least seven people were killed and 37 more remain missing after the explosion tore through the residential building in central , leaving hundreds without a home on New Year’s Eve.Only six survivors have been found, including a 13-year-old boy.A large section of the 10-storey building in the industrial city of , in the Ural mountains, crumbled at about 6am local time on Monday. The explosion happened before dawn, when many people were still asleep.The UK’s Met Office recorded overnight temperatures in the area as low as -26 degrees. Powerful heaters were deployed in the hope of stopping any trapped survivors from freezing to death.Workers had scoured the crushedconcrete and mangled steel throughout the night but the search was temporarily halted out of fear other sections of the structure could be unstable.On Tuesday, the head of Russia’s emergencies ministry, Yevgeny Zinichev, said there was a “real threat of part of the building collapsing. It’s impossible to continue working in such conditions”.Efforts to stabilise the walls could take up to 24 hours, precious time lost for rescuers ahead of a another sub-freezing night.The Soviet-era apartment block was home to about 1,100 people, and other residents had been evacuated to a nearby school. The blast completely destroyed 35 flats but others were left standing.Volunteers have offered money and clothing for victims, and some said they were ready to provide temporary shelter to those in need. Magnitogorsk, approximately 1,600kms east of Moscow, is home to one of the country’s largest steel producers.Staff from Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works took part in the rescue operation and the company’s chairman said it would provide financial assistance. rushed to the scene on Monday, with television broadcasts showing him looking concerned as he met local officials.“It is in the character of our people, despite new year’s festivities, to remember to think of the dead and wounded at this moment,” he said.Investigators have opened a criminal inquiry into the incident. - Guardian Subscribe.

Photograph: Zakaria Abdelkafi/AFP/Getty ImagesRioters set fire to a bank and ransacked stores on Paris’s landmark shopping street in a new flare-up of violence as France’s yellow vest protests against President  and his pro-business reforms entered a fourth month.Police fired tear gas and water cannon as the protests turned violent again after weeks of relative calm during marches, which had seen declining numbers of participants. Banque  branch spewed flames before firefighters arrived and rescued two people from the building, with 11 suffering minor injuries, the fire department said.Two news-stands on the Champs Elysees avenue caught fire and bonfires burned in the streets.Protesters threw cobblestones at riot police through clouds of tear gas in front of Paris’s Arc de Triomphe monument, which was ransacked at the peak of the protests in December.Police had arrested more 120 protesters by late afternoon as demonstrators looted stores around the Champs Elysees and ransacked the high-end Fouquet’s restaurant.The interior ministry estimated 10,000 people had participated in the protest in Paris, compared with 2,800 the previous Saturday. Elsewhere in , protesters were estimated at 4,500, compared with 4,200 last week.Interior minister  said that although the protest was relatively small, there were more than 1,500 “ultra violent” people out looking for trouble.“They decided, perhaps as a swansong, to come attack – and I use their words – Paris,” he said, adding more than 1,400 police officers were mobilised.“I’ve given instructions to the police this morning for great firmness so that nothing slips by,” he added.A separate, peaceful march against climate change through central Paris drew as many 30,000 people, the interior ministry estimated.Yellow vest protesters have promised to draw bigger numbers to mark the fourth month since the movement erupted in mid November, protesting against since-scrapped fuel tax hikes and high costs of living.Named after the high-visibility vests which French drivers are obliged to keep in their cars and are worn by protesters, the revolt swelled into a broader movement against Mr Macron and his reforms.The weekly demonstrations, held every Saturday in Paris and other cities, had been generally getting smaller since December, when Paris saw some of the worst vandalism and looting in decades.After the spike in violence, Mr Macron offered a package of concessions worth more than €10 billion aimed at boosting the incomes of the poorest workers and pensioners.His government ordered police to crack down on the protests in January, leading to complaints of police brutality.The 41-year-old former investment banker also launched a series of national debates which are aimed at determining what policies people want the government to focus on. – Reuters Subscribe.

Photograph:  Yoan Valat/EPAThe authority and competence of President  and his interior minister  have been called into question after hooligans laid waste to much of the Champs-Élysées on Saturday. It was the worst rioting since last December 1st.By Saturday night, 280 people had been arrested, 29 members of the security forces and about 60 gilets jaunes or yellow vest demonstrators were injured. Eighty shops, restaurants, newspaper kiosks and a bank were looted and/or set ablaze. Shops attacked included , , Célio, , , Lacoste, Longchamp, , , , ,  and . Looters threw clothing from the Zara outlet, and footballs from the Paris St Germain team’s store, into the crowds. Demonstrators shouted “Revolution!” and “To the Élysée!”The orgy of violence was carried out by a hard core of 1,500 hooligans wearing masks, black gloves and, in some cases, yellow vests. The most violent vandals are believed to be black bloc anarchists. Police said there were a total of 10,000 gilets jaunes on the Champs-Élysées, 30,000 across . By contrast, about 45,000 people marched in a separate, peaceful demonstration in Paris protesting inaction against global warming. Though the climate protesters far outnumbered the yellow vests, attention focused on the sacking of the Champs-Élysées. The first clashes occurred just after 10am, at the top of the avenue. At about 10.30, men in black masks surrounded by gilets jaunes attacked a gendarmerie vehicle. The gendarmes fired tear gas and stinger grenades. Security forces were concentrated at the bottom of the Champs Élyséés, on the approaches to the presidential palace. , the secretary general of the Unsa police union, said he was “scandalised” that 12 companies of CRS riot police were used to “sanctuarise” the Élysée while hooligans went on the rampage farther up the avenue.Around 12.30, the rioters attacked Fouquet’s, the historic brasserie that was James Joyce’s favourite. They hurled champagne bottles at police, knocked over tables and broke china. The former president  celebrated his election victory at Fouquet’s in 2007. “Sarko broke everything,” said graffitti scrawled on the restaurant. “This is a symbol, which is why it makes me happy,” a yellow vest in front of Fouquet’s told France Info radio. “I’m against attacking small businesses, but I don’t give a damn for Fouquet’s.” In late afternoon, demonstrators returned to set fire to the red and gold awnings. Some took selfies in front of the burning building. At about 1.30pm, demonstrators set fire to the , in the avenue Franklin Roosevelt. Inhabitants of the building panicked when smoke filled their apartments. A woman stood crying at a second floor window with a baby in her arms. A policeman ran up the stairs to rescue them. The gilets jaunes had promised an “ultimatum” for Macron on their 18th consecutive Saturday of demonstrations. Numbers had dwindled the previous week, and the authorities let down their guard. Yet the gilets jaunes gave ample warning. “Now we’re going to get serious. Act XVIII is on the way and Macron, you should watch out because mobilisation will be up,” , the lorry driver who is a leading figure in the movement, tweeted.Saturday’s riots showed how radicalised the movement has become. Ordinary gilets jaunes used to try to hold back the hooligans. No more. Yellow vests mocked those who had said they were running out of steam. “Before, the black blocs scared everybody,” a gilet jaune called John told Le Monde. “Now we see them as a plus. They’re the ones who push things forward. We are too pacifistic.” Macron had planned to take the weekend off with his wife, skiing in the Pyrenees, which he visited often in childhood. Social media postings of Macron grinning on the slopes and pouring wine for friends against a backdrop of snow-capped mountains had a devastating effect.Macron rushed back to Paris on Saturday evening to attend a crisis meeting at the interior ministry. He promised to take “strong, additional decisions” to prevent a repeat of such violence in Paris. “A lot has been done since November but clearly, today shows that we’re not there yet,” he continued. “All those who were there were accomplices” to the sacking of the Champs-Élysées, he added.“While Paris burns, Macron skis and Castaner demonstrates his incompetence again,” tweeted , the spokesperson for the conservative party Les Républicains. Macron had launched a “great national debate” in response to the demonstrations. He showed skill and energy in meetings with groups of citizens across France, and his popularity had returned to pre-gilets jaunes levels. Now Saturday’s riots risk wiping out the progress he had made. The tenacity of the movement has surprised everyone. Violent protests by a small, hardcore minority which demands Macron’s departure look set to continue for the foreseeable future. Subscribe.    Invalid email or password.</doc>

Photograph: Frederick Florin/AFPThe turn of the new year has ushered in the EU’s election season. In five months, voters across the union will cast ballots in a  vote that is an important test of the ability of the EU’s mainstream political families to resist the tide of populism that has swept the continent.The vote will also determine in a real sense how governable the EU is – the parliament is now a genuine co-legislator in many areas of EU policy and budgeting. Unless a working majority from across the mainstream parties – supporters of European integration – is sustained, there is a real danger that populists and Eurosceptics can bring about legislative gridlock.When it comes to substantive decisions, the parliament has never had consolidated coalitions with high levels of party discipline. MEPs join ad hoc alliances on different issues according to party, national and personal preferences. But on running the parliament’s business and the sharing of influential roles, the European People’s Party (EPP) and Social Democrats have always called the shots. Their task is set to become yet more difficult.A total of 751 MEPs currently represent some 500 million people from 28 member states. Following the UK withdrawal that number will fall to 701 in May’s elections.The new majority is 353, and aggregates of polls on Politico, as of January, suggest that the combined votes of the parliament’s three main parties – the centre-right EPP, the left Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D), and the Liberals (ALDE) – are likely, if the election were held now, to total only an uncomfortable majority with some 370 seats. The EPP is expected, on these figures, to lose some 32 seats and the S&amp;D 46 (in an admittedly reduced chamber).The balance would be made up of hard left, a block of well over 100 hard-right/populist Eurosceptics, with a sprinkling of out-and-out fascists and miscellaneous  and others including a new block of some 19 currently unattached Macronites from  (En Marche).The historic predominance of the EPP and S&amp;D in the parliament is on the wane although both remain the top vote-getters in Europe – in 13 member states, the EPP tops the polls. In France, ,  and , however, the top positions are taken by the populists – in France (79 seats), the new version of the  (National Rally) is outpolling Macron and likely to take 22 seats.In Italy (76 seats), the Liga of  looks likely to take 27 seats against its rival populist Five Star Movement’s 23. In Hungary, Viktor Orban’s Fidesz – a cuckoo in the nest of the EPP – may win an overall majority while Poland’s Law and Justice looks set to take some 24 of 52 seats.Perhaps the biggest casualty of the recent political turmoil is the one-time colossus of European social democracy. Today, the only EU country with an outright socialist government is , in addition to minority, coalition or caretaker governments in , , Portugal and Sweden. The party is on track to win only 142 seats on the back of just 20 per cent of the EU-wide vote.Epitomising the challenge, its candidate for the presidency of the European Commission – – , the Dutch commissioner, represents a party that is expected to win no more than three seats., the EPP’s Bavarian nominee, is expected to emerge comfortably at the head of the parliament’s largest group, but EU leaders who do not like having their choice foisted upon them by MEPs may be disinclined automatically to accept his nomination .The European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) candidate, Czech , has little chance of winning. A major obstacle to Zahradil’s plans will be the loss of the ECR’s biggest national delegation – 18 UK Conservatives. The ECR is expected to take some 51 seats.German MEP  and Dutch MEP  are co-candidates for the Greens.The system, under which the candidate from the party with the largest vote is nominated to EU leaders as MEPs’ choice for commission president, is an attempt by MEPs both to exercise power in the formation of the commission, and to persuade voters that they should see the elections as about the European-level exercise of power.These elections tend to be seen – and probably will again be seen – as what political scientists call “second order” elections, where voters use their ballots to pass judgment not on European political developments but on their own governments. Voter turnout has declined from 62 per cent in the first elections in 1979 to 42.6 per cent in 2014.But party politics has been undergoing a revolution at national level, a revolution that will reach Brussels and Strasbourg in 2019. Subscribe.

File photograph: Arterra/UIG via Getty ImagesThe  has backed plans to cut EU funds to member states who undermine the rule of law or allow corruption to fester – a move that could raise tensions between the bloc and the governments in  and , which are accused of weakening judicial independence.MEPs voted 397 to 158 for a draft law to freeze EU cash if a government was found to be eroding democratic values. The proposals will come into force if backed by EU member states and could lead to a fierce battle between national governments when they discuss the bloc’s next €1 trillion budget later this year.“Respecting the rule of law is a fundamental prerequisite for democracy, stability, prosperity and mutual trust,” said Petri Sarvamaa, a Finnish centre-right MEP backing the proposals. “Without the rule of law, the  loses its credibility in the eyes of the citizens and in the eyes of the world.”He added: “Taxpayers’ money has to be respected and spent according to the same rules and principles in all member states. We never know in which member state the rule of law will be questioned next.”The draft law is the latest attempt by EU politicians to get to grips with member states seen to be flouting the rule of law. While the EU has already opened disciplinary procedures against Poland and Hungary over the issue, officials have been looking for a better way of dealing with it.Critics have said the current process is slow and cumbersome, with some governments, including the UK, reluctant to condemn a fellow member state.Creating a link between the rule of law and EU funds would have a big impact on some national budgets, especially in central and eastern , where European money makes up a large proportion of infrastructure spending. In Poland, EU funds make up 61 per cent of public investment, and they make up 55 per cent of such investment in Hungary and 45 per cent in . According to the parliament’s proposals, countries would lose EU funds for “generalised deficiencies in the rule of law”, such as failure to investigate fraud, absence of independent courts, or failure to co-operate with EU anti-fraud inspectors. The plans would empower , aided by independent experts, to judge whether a government was breaking the rule of law, although EU governments would have four weeks to stop funds from being frozen.In an attempt not to isolate local populations, EU funds for NGOs and academic researchers would continue to flow.The final outcome of the proposals will not be known for months, as they are tied to a yet-to-be-decided agreement on the EU’s next €1 trillion budget, a seven-year plan for 2021-2028 that will not be agreed until after the forthcoming European elections.The rule of law plan adds another layer of complexity to the future budget debate, which is already fraught due to Brexit and the end of the UK’s annual net €10-11 billion contribution to the EU.Member states have been weighing up less ambitious proposals, but will not make their next move until EU leaders take a view.Countries in central and eastern Europe have already made their opposition plain, but Europe’s paymasters, notably ,  and the , want tougher action against governments that flout basic values while reaping EU funds. – Guardian Subscribe.

The treaty is meant to deepen co-operation between the countries as a means to also strengthen the European Union. Photograph: Sascha Schuermann/Getty ImagesFrance and Germany have signed a new treaty they say will boost bilateral co-operation and provide added stability to a continent experiencing a rise of nationalist, populist politics.Four months before the European Parliament elections, and 16 months after French president Emmanuel Macron’s ambitious EU reform proposals at the Sorbonne, Tuesday’s response was as much about symbolism as content.“Some 74 years after the end of the second World War, a human lifetime, what seems self-evident is being called into question,” said chancellor Angela Merkel, in a nod to new populist challengers on Europe’s political fringes.The Treaty of Aachen, signed in the German border city by Dr Merkel and Mr Macron, was billed a renewal of marital vows on the 56th birthday of the Élysée treaty underpinning modern bilateral relations.The document, aimed at reviving the Franco-German “motor” at the heart of the EU project, foresees closer EU policy consultation “at all levels” of government; creation of a new cross-border economic zone and economic expert body; closer co-operation on health and electro-mobility; joint rules for arms exports; and mutual recognition of each others’ school-leaving certificates. Mr Macron accused populists at home of “spreading lies” for suggesting that his efforts to assist Berlin in securing a permanent UN Security Council seat was a sell-out of French interests to Germany.“Those who forget the value of French-German reconciliation are making themselves accomplices of the crimes of the past,” he said.After a long history as sworn enemies and a century fighting two devastating world wars on opposite sides, modern Franco-German relations have no shortage of aspirational documents, promising greater efforts to boost cross-border exchanges, mutual language learning and advance business ties.But many vanish without trace after signing, squeezed by competing political agendas and models of French centralism versus German federalism.Mr Macron’s 2017 Sorbonne speech sparked ambitious proposals by the French and German parliaments: a common minimum wage; a common corporate tax base; a European innovation agency and a competence transfer back to their border region.The treaty contains some, not all, of these proposals, but in loose language and limited commitment.Pessimists suggest the window has closed for meaningful political co-operation between Mr Macron, under pressure from domestic street protests, and Dr Merkel, who no longer heads her political party.Wolfgang Schäuble, the Bundestag president and number two in Germany’s political pecking order, has made no secret of feeling duped by the political leaders and their Aachen event.For months German MPs and their French counterparts have been working on proposals to boost co-operation, including a new committee with 50 MPs each, meeting twice a year.Parliaments agreed last autumn to sign their agreement on Tuesday. Then, two weeks ago, Dr Schäuble was informed of the Merkel-Macron event in Aachen on the same day. Aware of the criticism of the Aachen Treaty, Dr Merkel promised to “really fill it with life”.“We will do this,” she said, “with full energy and all of our heart”. Subscribe.

Video: ReutersFirefighters survey the damage following a gas-leak explosion in Paris. Photograph: Christophe Ena/APInhabitants of Paris’s ninth district feared an earthquake, plane crash or bomb, when a powerful explosion at 6, rue de Trevise, killed at least four people and injured 50 others, 10 seriously, just before 9am on Saturday.Injuries included smoke inhalation, burns and broken bones or wounds from flying debris.A woman living on the second floor of the building called the fire brigade at 8.45am to complain of a strong smell of gas. Firemen arrived 10 minutes later, just before the explosion which gutted the ground floor of Hubert bakery, the basement and first floor of the building.Authorities do not know if the gas leak occurred in the bakery, which was closed, the adjacent restaurant or the basement.Two firemen were killed,  (28) from the French alps and  (27) from Burgundy. “They took the full force of the blast,” said  of the Paris fire department. A crowdfunding website raised €12,000 for the families of the firemen by Sunday morning. (38) from Burgillos, near Toledo, died hours later in hospital. The Spanish mother-of-three was spending a week’s holiday with her husband at the hotel across the street.The body of the fourth fatality, a woman who lived on the first floor directly above the explosion, was found buried in debris on Sunday.A third fireman, , was buried for two hours before he was dug out by colleagues. He is hospitalised in serious condition, but his life is no longer in danger.The explosion is believed to have been caused by a gas leak, “but we’re not excluding any possibility”, said Paris prosecutor Rémy Heitz. The judiciary police have opened an investigation.Dazed residents of the area wandered out of apartments and hotels into the street, some bleeding and others wearing underclothes or pyjamas. Buildings were damaged in the rues de Trevise, Montyon, Sainte-Cécile and Bergère, over a radius of 100m. The residents of 12 buildings will not be allowed to return until experts certify the structures are safe – “several days at a minimum”, said first deputy mayor of Paris Emmanuel Grégroire.The town hall of the ninth district was turned into an emergency centre, dispensing food, beverages and psychological counselling. Facebook activated its “Safety Check” feature, which is usually used to enable individuals to reassure loved ones that they have survived a terrorist attack or natural disaster.About 150 people were placed in temporary lodging at a gymnasium in the adjacent 10th district, in hotels and in the homes of volunteers.  Rescue helicopters landed and took off from the square in front of the Opera Garnier, because demonstrations by protesters had blocked many streets.Conservative city Cllr , who is a member of the gas safety commission, sparked a controversy by telling newspaper that the Paris network, which is more than a century old, “is in a state of advanced and catastrophic decrepitude . . . When you talk to firemen they tell you, ‘the number one problem in Paris is gas’.”The ecology ministry says 52 people died between 2010 and 2014 in accidents due to natural gas and gas cannisters. Mr Vesperini suggested it might be necessary to change to an all electric system.Mayor of the ninth district Delphine Burklicalled Mr Vesperini’s allegations “indecent”. She said it was “time to help the victims and organise assistance, not this kind of debate”.The gas company GRDF said it spends €50 million annually to maintain the network and that 40km of gas pipes have been renovated. Subscribe.

French runner stripped of European gold in bizarre incident
Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad took off vest in home straight
3,000m steeplechase star disqualified for indiscretion
He has previous history of controversial incidents
It may have seemed like a good idea at the time but Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad's bizarre celebration in the home straight of the men's 3,000m steeplechase at the European championships has cost him dear.
Approaching the final barrier, the Frenchman had the race and gold medal in the bag, having enough time in hand to showboat by stripping off his running vest before putting it into his mouth and waving to the crowd.
Fans in the Letzigrund Stadium in Zurich jeered as he crossed the finishing line clear of his teammate Yoann Kowal in eight minutes 25.30 seconds -- his third straight victory in the event at the championships after 2010 and 2012.
The 29-year-old had the presence of mind to put his top back after the finish, but the damage was done.

He was initially shown a yellow card as a warning by an official, but an appeal by Spain on behalf of fourth placed athlete Angel Mullera led to his disqualification.
His French team lodged a counter-protest but that was rejected, with Mekhissi-Benabbad disqualified under IAAF competition rules 143.1, 143.7. -- relating to clothing and numbers. 
Mullera was promoted to the bronze as result of the ruling.
"I find that the protest lodged by the Spaniards is anti fair-play," Ghani Yalouzsa, the technical director of the French athletics federation, was quoted by AFP.
But the double Olympic silver medalist is no stranger to controversy.  After winning his 2012 Euro gold in Helsinki he was criticized for shoving a mascot who offered him a gift.
The year before, Mekhissi-Benabbad was involved in a punch-up with French teammate Mehdi Baala at the 2011 Monaco Diamond League meeting, trading blows while they were still on the track and earning a five-month suspension from their federation.

Paris (CNN)
French President Emmanuel Macron has condemned abuse by a group of "yellow vest" protesters, after a well-known philosopher was verbally attacked at a rally in Paris on Saturday.
Several gilets jaunes (or "yellow vest") protesters were filmed hurling abuse at philosopher and vocal Israel supporter Alain Finkielkraut as he ran into protesters during the 14th consecutive weekend of marches.
Insults including "dirty zionist," "f***ing Islamophobe" and "f*** your mother" were hurled at Finkelkraut, while less hostile activists walked him away from the demonstration and behind police lines.

"The son of Polish emigrants who became a French academician, Alain Finkielkraut is not only an eminent man of letters but a symbol of what the Republic allows everyone," Macron wrote on Twitter.
"The anti-Semitic insults he has been subjected to are the absolute negation of who we are and what makes us a great nation. We will not tolerate them," he added.

Finkielkraut reacted in French weekly newspaper Le Journal Du Dimanche on Saturday, saying: "I felt absolute hatred, and unfortunately it wasn't the first time."
The Paris prosecutor's office has launched an investigation into "public abuse on the basis of origin, ethnicity, country, race or religion," an offense that carries a maximum sentence of one year in jail and a 45,000-euro ($51.000) fine.
Anti-Semitic acts in France increased by 69% in the first nine months of 2018, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in November.

Every week, I offer a glimpse of the kind of intelligence assessments that are likely to come across the desk of the President of the United States, modeled on the President's Daily Briefing, or PDB, which the director of national intelligence prepares for the President almost daily.
Here's this week's briefing
:
 Sam Vinograd
With new 
Washington Post reporting
 that President Donald Trump may have taken unprecedented, and 
potentially illegal
, measures to conceal the contents of private conversations with President Vladimir Putin, we are providing you with an update on several ongoing Russian threat streams. These include the growing counterintelligence risks posed by actions that aid and abet Russian intelligence operations.
The full panoply of Russian actions -- from election interference to the manipulation of those whom Putin considers high-value American assets -- pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. And Trump's efforts to keep meetings with Putin under wraps only exacerbate this threat.
Under his thumb 
Read More
Despite the President and his team's 
denials
  regarding allegations that he tried to conceal the contents of his meetings with Putin, reporting indicating that he went to 
extraordinary measures
 to do just that  will add to Putin's perception that he's in the driver's seat. More to the point, Putin will feel like he can manipulate any narrative about the meetings. He may even try to spread theories (whether warranted or not) that there was an intent to conceal evidence of a crime -- whether criminal or counterintelligence related -- because that undermines the credibility of the President himself. Absent our own records of the meeting, we have nothing we can use to counter any Russian misinformation about what happened.  
World leaders are talking, Mr. Trump -- are you listening? 
Even worse, giving the Russian government sensitive information that US officials do not have -- information on what was discussed in meetings between Putin and Trump -- also represents a major operational risk. The Russian government likely has more knowledge than our own administration does  on key bilateral policy discussions, including Israel, which 
Trump acknowledged
 that they discussed. 
It's also an intelligence win for Putin. Russian officials' access to this sensitive information represents a potential bribery point the Putin can use against Trump at a later date. Russia can threaten to release parts of presidential conversations if, for example, Trump threatens to do something that they don't like. In short, by concealing the contents of his meetings, the President is opening the door for Putin to manipulate him and use him as an asset.
Because the President has given Putin and his team a leg up on the US government, Putin may also try to benefit from any perceptions that the President prefers playing for the Russians more than he does for the US. Putin gets bonus points in this scenario because, by failing to treat his team with the same consideration that he treats Russia, Trump is implying a lack of confidence in his own institutions and officials.

NYT: FBI feared Trump was working on behalf of Russia

MUST WATCH

The Washington Post reporting comes on the heels of news that the FBI launched an unprecedented counterintelligence investigation into whether Trump posed a threat to national security -- a news story that will only embolden Putin further. The very fact that the FBI assessed that Putin was potentially willing to compromise a sitting president will probably bolster the vision of himself as a strong, skilled and fearless leader.  
Trump's responses to the reporting -- including insulting
 FBI officials
, 
Democrats
 and 
past US presidents
 -- rather than clearly stating that Russian intelligence operations against us are a threat that we should all take seriously, are music to Putin's ears because they advance Russia's mission to spread division in the US.
Putin will probably use his information warriors to spread the administration's responses on social media, because they appear to promote Russian objectives rather than US national security ones. We know that Russian troll farms 
have engaged
 in influence campaigns on social media in the past to spread inflammatory or divisive messages, so they likely have the ability to do so now.  
A czar is born
Putin is due to relinquish power in 2024, but if he has his way, he may continue ruling Russia long after that. Russia still pretends to be a democracy, and its constitution currently puts term limits on presidents. But the Russian Duma 
is considering
 constitutional amendments that, if passed, could allow Putin to extend his rein for as long as he likes. Putin is increasingly emulating a czar-like ruler for life, who does what he wants, when he wants. Domestically, we should expect Putin to continue his crackdown on opposition movements and minority groups while he continues to pursue a full suite of externally aggressive activities.
The world is his oyster
Bolstered by feelings of impunity, Putin is ramping up, not tamping down, his global interference efforts. Israeli officials 
have alluded
 to Russian interference in their upcoming elections. French authorities 
are probing
 potential Russian interference during the "gilets jaunes," or yellow vest protests, and US Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats
 publicly acknowledged 
 Russian efforts to interfere in our midterm elections. Whatever actions have been taken to date, it's clear that Putin thinks the world -- along with its elections -- is his oyster. 
He'll pack our bags for us
The administration's focus on bringing US troops back home, even if missions are not complete in key theaters like Syria, is a boon to Russian plans to expand its own sphere of influence. Putin will likely try to expedite a rapid US departure from Syria because it helps him paint the US as an unreliable partner, while concurrently giving him more room to operate in Syria itself. 
What really makes the Trump presidency scary
Without US troops on the ground or US funding that goes toward stabilization efforts in Syria, Putin can claim we don't have skin in the game -- whereas he has resources on the ground and the ability to convene key players, including Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iran's Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei. We should also be on the lookout for indications of chemical weapons attacks as we prepare to leave. Russia used chemical weapons in the UK (though the Kremlin denies it), and the Kremlin has also
 repeatedly lied
 and said Assad hasn't used them in Syria. 
Nuking it
Conventional military threats from Putin will likely continue. Showcasing his biggest and baddest military toys helps broadcast both the strength of the Russian military, while 
highlighting Russian weapons
 like hypersonic missiles, which we 
are not adequately prepared
 to defend against. Factually speaking, he doesn't need expensive nuclear weapons to strategically threaten the United States. He is accomplishing that goal with relatively inexpensive cybersecurity attacks and information warfare. But a nuclear showdown gets him bonus points at home, while leading us to spend money just to keep up.

Our public narrative right now is a key component of neutralizing Russian threats. Claims that this administration
 has been tougher
 on Russia than any of its predecessors misses the underlying point -- Putin is not changing his behavior. In fact, he is consolidating power while Russia is escalating its activities and posing a direct threat to US strategic interests. 
If this public response narrative continues, it only serves Putin's interests, not ours. By failing to acknowledge that we have not successfully defended against Russia's attack or deterred its illegal activities, we look more focused on our own image than on keeping our country safe.

Protesters gathered Tuesday night in cities across France to march against anti-Semitism after a rise in such incidents in the country.
The marches came after around 80 graves were desecrated with swastikas overnight in a Jewish cemetery in eastern France, according to local officials. Photos showed tombstones spray-painted with blue and yellow Nazi symbols and other graffiti.
Graves were vandalized with swastikas at a Jewish cemetery in the French village of Quatzenheim.
French President Emmanuel Macron condemned the attack during his visit Tuesday to the cemetery in Quatzenheim, where he inspected the damage.
"We will take actions, we will use laws and we will punish," Macron told local communities leaders at the cemetery. 
"Those who did this are not worthy of the republic. ... France will punish them. I don't want what happened here to give ideas to others."

The attack comes after anti-government gilets jaunes or "yellow vest" protesters 
hurled verbal abuse Saturday 
at philosopher and Israel supporter Alain Finkielkraut as he ran into the demonstrators on the 14th consecutive weekend of their marches.
It was also the second recent attack at a Jewish cemetery in France. Tombstones and a holocaust memorial 
outside Strasbourg were vandalized in December.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was shocked at the vandalism in Quatzenheim and called on leaders in France and Europe to "take a strong stand against anti-Semitism."
"It is a plague that endangers everyone, not just us, and it must be condemned wherever and whenever it rears its head," Netanyahu said.

Anti-Semitic incidents on the rise
The country, which is home to the
 500,000 Jews -- the largest community in Europe
 -- has seen a 74% increase in anti-Semitic acts, according to 
French authorities
, with 311 incidents recorded in 2017, compared with 541 in 2018.
At least 11 people have been killed in anti-Semitic violence in France since 2016. Last March, 85-year-old Holocaust survivor Mireille Knoll was slain in her Paris apartment, an act of brutality that compelled thousands to protest in the capital.

In 2017, Sarah Halimi, 65, was also killed in her apartment in the city and thrown from her balcony in what was called an anti-Semitic attack.
In 2015, four people were killed and 15 others were held hostage at a
 kosher supermarket in Paris in a siege
 carried out by an associate of the Charlie Hebdo shooters. Three years earlier, three children and one teacher were slain at 
a Jewish school in Toulouse
. 
A 2018 
CNN survey of seven European countries 
-- Great Britain, Sweden, Germany, France, Poland, Hungary and Austria -- pointed to the prevalence of anti-Semitism in Europe. Anti-Semitic stereotypes proved widespread in France, where a quarter of respondents said Jews had too much influence in business and finance.
The study also revealed ignorance about the Holocaust, particularly among younger generations. One in five French people between 18 and 34 said they'd never heard of the Holocaust.

Paris (CNN)
French President Emmanuel Macron condemned protesters who brought central Paris to a halt Saturday amid claims that the far right had infiltrated the march, which turned violent.
"Thank you to all our law enforcement, for their courage and professionalism. Shame on all the people who assaulted them," Macron tweeted. "Shame to those who voluntarily assaulted citizens and reporters. Shame on those who tried to intimidate our elected."
 
The demonstrations included protesters lighting fires and police using tear gas and water cannons to disperse them. One-hundred thirty people were arrested Saturday in protests across France, with 42 detained in Paris.
A spokesman for the Interior Ministry said two police officers and six other people were injured. 
A protest organizer labeled the events a "civil war."

"The objective was to unite everybody here in Paris. I am disappointed because it wasn't meant to be like this," Thierry Paul Valette, one of the organizers, told CNN.
He blamed it on a "small section" of "the extreme left and the extreme right."
The protests came to the attention of US President Donald Trump on Sunday, who renewed his complaints about what he said was mistreatment of the US by Europe.
The large and violent French protests don't take into account how badly the United States has been treated on Trade by the European Union or on fair and reasonable payments for our GREAT military protection. Both of these topics must be remedied soon.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 
November 25, 2018


The "yellow vest" protests began as a campaign against rising gas prices and have morphed into a wider demonstration against Macron's government in recent weeks, spreading as far as France's
Indian Ocean territory of Réunion.
Police said they have mobilized 3,000 officers in Paris to contain 8,000 protesters. A security perimeter was set up in the city center, with government buildings protected. 
At a news conference Saturday, French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner blamed the clashes on far-right extremists infiltrating the demonstrations.
"Today, the far right has mobilized,"  Castaner told reporters. "The security forces perfectly anticipated this situation."
He added: "The right to protest cannot go beyond the respect of the fundamental law of our country."
There were more than 106,00 protesters nationwide, he said. 
Far-right political leader Marine Le Pen rejected the accusations, describing them as a "pathetic and dishonest" form of "political manipulation" by the government.
Earlier Castaner said of the protesters: "Their freedom of expression will be guaranteed, but it must not be exercised to the detriment of security, public order and the right of everybody to come and go. There is no liberty without public order."
Last weekend a protester was accidentally 
run over and killed by a car
, and more than 200 people were injured during a demonstration in eastern France.
Protesters clash with riot police who fired tear gas canisters Saturday in central Paris.
Macron under fire
Besides concerns over spiraling fuel prices, the protests also reflect long-running tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor.
Diesel prices have surged 16% this year from an average 1.24 euros ($1.41) per liter to 1.48 euros ($1.69), even hitting 1.53 euros in October, according to UFIP, France's oil industry federation.
The price hike is largely caused by a leap in the wholesale price of oil, with Brent crude oil -- a benchmark for worldwide oil purchases -- increasing by more than 20% in the first half of 2018 from around $60 a barrel to a peak of $86.07 in early October.
French protesters are, however, not directing their anger at OPEC for reducing oil production, or at the US administration for implementing tariffs on Iran, crippling its oil exports.
Macron is bearing the brunt of widespread French discontent, with many protesters furious at his extension of environmental policies implemented under his predecessor, François Hollande.
There is also widespread dissatisfaction over tax increases on diesel and gas.
The protests have morphed into a wider demonstration against Emmanuel Macron's government.
Further revolts
The growing resentment has also been a springboard for partisan political attacks, with opponents of Macron's centrist En Marche party attempting to energize their bases to fuel further revolt.
Ludivine Landrin, a 32-year-old protester from near Paris, explained why she was protesting. "I'm here because I am a citizen. I want the struggle to come together. I want the French state to understand that we are here together. We want another state, we want another government," she told CNN.
"In France we have a lot of taxes. The beginning of the movement was about taxes on fuel. The movement became bigger because all the taxes are making people fed up. The Macron government is making everyone fed up -- on the right and on the left. We are all fed up with Macron and his government."
Another protester, 33-year-old Emilie, declared that a revolution was happening. "We pay our taxes, but it is only the rich who profit," she said.

Sully H.W. Bush, the former service dog to late President George H.W. Bush, has started a new job with the US Navy at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington.
During a ceremony streamed live on 
Facebook on Wednesday,
 the yellow Labrador was appointed to the rank of hospital corpsman second class.
"Your appointment as a petty officer in the United States Navy makes you heir to a long and proud tradition of naval leadership," said a Navy spokesman at the Bethesda, Maryland, ceremony. The dog then was outfitted with a new "military uniform" -- a vest representing the medical center's dog team.
Sully H.W. Bush, former service dog to the late President George H.W. Bush, being sworn in at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on February 27, 2019 in Bethesda, Maryland.
Sully's personalized oath of enlistment: "Do you affirm or pant as a hospital corpsman in the United States Navy that you will support, comfort and cure warriors and their families, active duty and retired? That you embrace our staff and bear unconditional love and solace, especially on busy days? That you take this obligation freely, without any promise of treats or tummy rubs and that you will faithfully discharge the duties to provide joy, love and nurturing for our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and sailors and their families?"
Sully joins the medical center's facility dog program. His duties will include reducing stress and increasing well-being among patients and staff.

The dog captured hearts last year after a photo went viral of Sully resting near President Bush's casket at the US Capitol.
Named after Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger
, the pilot who safely landed US Airways Flight 1549 in New York's Hudson River, Sully was assigned to President Bush through a request on his behalf after the passing of former first lady Barbara Bush.
"When we received the request for President Bush, we knew we needed to find a dog that was super adaptable, because the President did a lot of traveling and got a lot of visitors," 
Brad Hibbard, chief program officer at Guide Dog Foundation for the Blind/America's VetDogs, told CNN
 last year.
"The Bush Years: Family, Duty, Power"
"We immediately thought of Sully. We knew he was the right dog for the job, especially with Mr. Bush being older and in a wheelchair. He needed a dog that would also help him with daily tasks."
Trained by America's VetDogs
 -- a nonprofit organization that trains service dogs for disabled military veterans and first responders -- to be a service dog, therapy dog and guide dog, Sully is capable of doing a number of tasks, from answering phones to turning lights on and off.
"Not only is he good at retrieving things, he helped the President by opening doors, knew when to get assistance from someone else, and knew when Bush needed comfort, so he would place his head on his lap," 
Hibbard said
.
The service dogs at Walter Reed collectively work over 200 hours per month and average 2,500 contacts, according to a spokesperson for for the facility.

While world leaders gather in Katowice, Poland, for the COP24 climate summit, protesters in the streets of Paris have successfully forced French President Emmanuel Macron's hand, undercutting his efforts to impose a carbon tax on French energy sales. Macron has made climate change and lowering greenhouse gases a central component of both his domestic and foreign policies, only to face dramatic failure at the hands of his 
"yellow vest"
 countrymen.
Laurie Garrett
Macron's popularity has been low in France for months, and has now fallen to just a 
23%
 approval rating. But the rioting across his country sends a 
frightening signal
 to politically powerful advocates seeking to save the planet from its predicted catastrophic 2 degree Celsius average temperature increase by midcentury. 
With the Trump administration having pulled out of the Paris COP21 agreement -- which is the foundation of the current Katowice talks -- and Macron paying such a significant price for his efforts, leaders of all political stripes 
must wonder
 how to effectively tackle climate change without facing uprisings, dissent and stock market downturns.
The short answer: Do not follow Macron's example. In imposing this tax, Macron took a top-down approach, not consulting the very people who would be most adversely affected by it: his fellow countrymen. He listened to economists and top French business leaders who, correctly, named taxation as one way to drive down fossil fuel use and decrease France's carbon footprint. 
Paris demonstrations could put Macron's future in jeopardy
But the tax hit the nation's poor and rural populations hard, forcing many to pit their energy needs against putting food on the family table. As a result, this protest, unlike other French uprisings, attracted individuals of varying political ideologies and from rural and urban environments alike.

With Angela Merkel announcing plans to step down as German Chancellor, Macron is the last forceful voice for globalization and adherence to multinational solutions to tough problems like climate change. The Financial Times editorial board 
warned
 on December 3, "If this standard bearer for pro-European and liberal democratic values handles the current situation badly, it could fuel populism in France and across the continent."
But a day later Macron backed off from his so-called "green taxes," and now his government, and its pursuit of climate solutions are in crisis. If Macron was serious about combating climate change, he would have engaged in a more grassroots process, engaging the French people in a serious dialogue about concrete steps they could take as a country -- ensemble.
Macron's approach is hardly surprising. From the beginning, he has believed top-down government action and corporate policies are most effective in bringing about change by altering demand in the marketplace of greenhouse gas-producing products.

MUST WATCH
 
02:15
As former political allies have turned away from globalization, and the Trump administration pulled the United States out of the COP21 process, Macron has trumpeted some of his environmental approaches most loudly in rooms full of CEOs. 
Two months before the yellow vest protests, at the One Planet Summit organized by Michael Bloomberg, the French leader excitedly spoke off-script about confronting climate change. Macron warned that the $100 billion companies there promised for climate action, "could be pure bulls--t." Yet, he said, "there undoubtedly is a change in the philosophy of finance -- it is a climate finance partnership. ... This initiative must be at the very core of the global business model."  
That model, Macron insisted, should aim at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, saving the world's oceans and halting biodiversity loss. With France set to host the 2019 G7 Summit, Macron turned to the business leaders in New York's posh Plaza Hotel and said, "This One Planet Club should be part of the G7. I want to put you at the center of the G7."
Macron's eager absorption of corporate capitalism into the global governance of climate change now threatens to blow up in his face. It was never about democracy -- how could it be? The world's working poor have no seats in the boardrooms or on the stock markets, and no influence over Amazon's carbon emissions schemes or the success of Tesla electric trucks. 
How 2018 became Angela Merkel's swan song, and who will succeed her?
The Carbon Disclosure Project, or CDP Worldwide, 
tracks
 corporate and financial industry climate commitments, listing the promises. And Michael Bloomberg and Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney created the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or 
TCFD
, which also tracks, according to its website, "more than 275 companies, with a combined market capitalization of more than $6.6 trillion ... and more than 160 financial firms — responsible for assets of over $86.2 trillion."
But these carbon reduction promises aren't government treaties, and their commitments are self-reported. Simply put, the world community has no means to hold the corporations  to account. So, when Walmart vows to remove 1 gigaton of CO2 from its emissions by 2030, or Blackrock CEO Larry Fink tells the summit audience that some of his company's nearly $7 trillion in managed assets will be directed to 140 environment projects, or Mars Corp. promises to cut greenhouse gases by 27% by 2025, there is no way angry French farmers can discern the truthful outcome of such lofty aspirations. 
On the eve of the Katowice gathering, a group of CEOS, representing numerous sectors across 150 countries, 
wrote
, "We stand ready to fast-track solutions to help you deliver on an enhanced and more ambitious action plan to tackle climate change and meet the goals set out at the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. We know this is possible."
Trump retweets apparently false claim of Paris protesters chanting
That said, as 200 nations debate the future of the planet in Katowice over the coming days, Macron's romance with billionaire climate investors -- or, at least, promisers -- forms a cautionary tale. There are real limits to the government go-arounds for action. On their own, corporations cannot impose carbon taxes, build sustainable transportation systems, balance the needs of rural and urban populations, relocate hundreds of millions of soon-to-be-underwater world's citizens or regulate pollution.
Like it or not, corporations need governments -- locally, provincially and multinationally. And if those governments refuse to tackle the carbon dioxide crisis in a manner that garners popular support, company policies cannot serve as substitutes. The marketplace, locally or globally, cannot replace government action and regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.
No matter what their diverse, in some cases reactionary, individual politics may be, the yellow vests have issued a battle cry that every politician -- and all of the Katowice participants -- must heed. The 
graffiti
 on the walls of Paris declares Macron is "president of the rich," ominously warning, "We cut off heads for less than this."
It would be terrible, beyond all words, were the strategies for confronting climate change to be so ill-conceived and poorly executed that metaphoric guillotine-hungry mobs ruled the opposition with populist, nationalistic rage.

Addressing the opening of COP24 this week, Britain's  
Sir David Attenborough
 labeled climate change "our greatest threat in thousands of years," chastising politicians by adding, "Leaders of the world, you must lead." There are no easy go-arounds, avoiding the pro-fossil fuel interests in the Middle East, Moscow and Washington. Democracy and governance are hard, at times seemingly impossible. 
As another Englishman, Winston Churchill, famously lectured the House of Commons in 1947, "No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government, except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time." 
As exhausting and daunting as it may be, climate leaders must pay heed to the cries of France's yellow vests, and the angry masses inside their own nations. A corporate boardroom or gathering of CEOs may be more comfortable. But curing the world's climate catastrophe, pulling humanity from its existential brink, requires nothing less than solutions found, and supported, across whole societies.

Two bystanders helped subdue the Times Square driver until police came
"I basically was on instinct," one of the heroes said
 (CNN)
Kenya Bradix heard the screams.
The longtime Planet Hollywood bouncer saw a red car driving on the sidewalk into crowds of pedestrians near New York City's Times Square. He saw the car smash into a metal pole, saw a man hop out of the car flailing his arms and screaming, and saw others try -- but fail -- to grab him.
So he ran after the suspect himself.
"I saw an opportunity and tackled him to the ground from his left side," Bradix told HLN on Friday. "I got him down, turned him on his stomach."
Bouncer Kenya Bradix wrestled the fleeing Times Square suspect to the ground before police took over.
Nearby, Alpha Balde, a father of eight from Guinea, was helping move a man out of harm's way when he heard the commotion just before noon Thursday.

Balde, in the trademark yellow shirt and red vest worn by employees of the New York City sightseeing bus company Gray Line, looked to his left and saw Bradix tackle the man. He sprung into motion.
Alpha Balde helped subdue the suspect in Times Square. He helped stop a bank robber in 2007.
Balde ran to the suspect and put his hands around the man's neck to keep him down, he said. Balde also patted the suspect down and searched him to make sure he didn't have a weapon.
Balde and Bradix were joined within a minute by a handful of on-duty and undercover New York police officers, who took over the scene and arrested the suspect. 
Police have
 identified the driver as Richard Rojas
, a 26-year Bronx resident who intentionally drove onto the sidewalk in an attempt to "kill them all," he told police, according to a criminal complaint. He was charged with murder and 20 counts of attempted murder.
Now two days later, Balde and Bradix are being praised for their bravery and willingness to risk their own safety to stop a fleeing suspect in one of the most popular places in the world. Yet in separate interviews, both said they weren't scared at that moment and downplayed any suggestion they're heroes.
"I'm just trying to help," Balde said.
'I was in security mode'
For Balde, the incident was all a little familiar. Back in August 2007, he tackled a man fleeing a bank robbery and was featured as a crime-stopping hero in the 
New York Post
.
To this day, Balde keeps a photocopy of that story folded up in his pocket.
"I keep this for my record. You never know," said Balde, who moved to the US decades ago. "I've got the newspaper at home, so I always make a copy."
Heroes Alpha Balde and Kenya Bradix are pictured with New York City police officers and other bystanders apprehending Richard Rojas.
Bradix, a buff man with imposing biceps, has worked security at the Times Square restaurant for 25 years, he said on HLN on Friday. 
When he saw the screaming suspect, then heard a man say "Get him, get him," Bradix jumped up and, well, got him, he said.
"At that moment, I guess I was in security mode, I would call it. I basically was on instinct," he said. "And I didn't think for a second if he had anything (dangerous)
 
or what could he possibly do. I was just thinking, 'Just get the guy down and subdue him 'til the police came.'"
Photos show Times Square driver trying to flee carnage
Despite his decades of work in Times Square, Bradix said he'd never seen anything like this.
"You don't expect this to happen. Or when you do see it, it's always on TV, some other state, but not right in front of you," Bradix said. "This happened in front of me."
In an interview Saturday with CNN in Times Square, Balde said he's been getting handshakes and praise from friends and strangers who recognized him from the news. As he recounted taking down Rojas, two people
interrupted to shake his hand or get a photo.
And though this was Balde's second crime-stopping adventure, it may not be his last.
"I'm ready to do the same thing again," he said. "(If) you're gonna come in New York City trying to hurt somebody, come in this area here, you don't have no chance. Because we're gonna keep our eyes open."

Paris (CNN)
French police clashed Saturday in Paris with protesters staging a fourth weekend of "gilets jaunes," or "yellow vest," demonstrations against the government of President Emmanuel Macron.
Rubber bullets found on the Avenue de Friedland on Saturday in Paris.
Officers fired rubber bullets and hundreds of canisters of tear gas at the demonstrators, some of whom had set vehicles on fire. 
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said 135 people were wounded in Saturday's protests across France.
According to a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, 1,723 people were taken in for questioning and 1,220 were taken into custody. 
Two photographers from the newspaper Le Parisien were hit by projectiles. One was taken to hospital as dusk drew near in a city still in shock from last weekend's riots -- the worst to hit the French capital in decades.

Protesters could be heard calling for Macron's resignation Saturday in Paris.
Macron will address the demonstrations Monday, according to the Élysée Palace.
Some 136,000 joined in Saturday's protests across France, the interior minister said, with about 10,000 in Paris. The latter converged around midday on the Champs-Élysées, with many dressed in "gilets jaunes," the yellow high-visibility jackets that have become the symbol of the movement. 
Police used water cannons in a bid to disperse the crowd.  
Tires were also set on fire. As protests turned violent toward the end of the day security forces deployed tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons.
A smaller "yellow vest" demonstration of about 500 people also took place in the Belgian capital of Brussels near the European Parliament, according to the newspaper Le Soir.

Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, President Donald 
Trump claimed the protests
, which started in reaction to an eco-tax on gas,
underscored his decision not to sign the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. 
"The Paris Agreement isn't working out so well for Paris," he tweeted. "Protests and riots all over France. People do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries (that are questionably run), in order to maybe protect the environment. Chanting 'We Want Trump!' Love France."

CNN reporters on the ground said the only time they heard Trump mentioned was as a joke when they were recording. 
Earlier, TV images showed French protesters parading past the flagship stores of some of Paris' best-known luxury brands such as Mont Blanc and Cartier, all with their shutters tightly fastened on what would usually be a busy shopping day before Christmas.
Anticipating a repeat of last weekend's violence, monuments such as the Eiffel Tower and many of the city's Metro stations remained closed,
with about 8,000 police on the streets of Paris and tens of thousands more deployed across the country.

"We have to change the Republic," Ilda, a yellow jacket protester from the south of France near Toulouse, told CNN. "People here are starving. Some people earn just 500 euros a month; you can't afford to live. People don't want to stop because we want the President to go."
Patrice, a pensioner from Paris, said he was protesting because of "the government and the taxes and all these problems. We have to survive."
Who are the 'yellow vest' protesters causing chaos in France?
With more unrest expected in other parts of France, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said the government was deploying 89,000 security force members across the country.
Philippe said that "it's time for dialogue" between politicians and representatives of the protesters.
The French retail sector has suffered a loss in revenue of about $1.1 billion since the beginning of the yellow vest protests last month, a spokeswoman for the French retail federation, Sophie Amoros, told CNN. 
Amid heightened tensions, police seized 28 petrol bombs and three homemade explosive devices Friday at an area blockaded by protesters in Montauban in southern France, a spokesman for the Tarn-et-Garonne prefecture told CNN.
Protesters gather near the Arc de Triomphe Saturday in the French capital.
Dominique Moisi, a foreign policy expert at the Paris-based Institut Montaigne and a former Macron campaign adviser, told CNN the French presidency was not only in crisis but that Europe's future also hung in the balance.
"In a few months from now, there will be European elections, and France was supposed to be the carrier of hope and European progress. What happens if it's no longer? If the President is incapacitated to carry that message?" Moisi asked.

"It's about the future of democracy, as well; illiberal democracies are rising all over the world. And if Macron fails, the future of France risks looking like the presidency of Italy today. And it's much more serious because we have a centralized state, which plays a major role in the balance of power within Europe. 
Protesters take to the steets against President Emmanuel Macron's government.
"But make no mistake, it is a French version of a much more global phenomenon."
France's far-left CGT movement has pledged support for the protests, which also are backed by the far-right leader Marine Le Pen.

Researchers developed technologies to help service dogs call for help in a medical emergency
"The bond between a person and a service dog is unlike any other," one researcher says
 (CNN)
Melody Jackson's beloved grandmother Eleanor was in the kitchen when she fell. 
Her cries for help went unheard, and her feeble attempts to lift herself up were unsuccessful. At the time of the fall, Eleanor was in her 90s, and it was some 20 years ago, but the memory remains with Jackson to this day.
"She had to wait for her neighbor to get home from work to get up," Jackson said. "The family obviously was terrified, so we bought her one of those necklaces, those alert necklaces. ... Well, she didn't like wearing it."
However, if Eleanor had a small lapdog at the time, the dog not only could have been a companion, it could have helped her when she fell, said Jackson, an associate professor and director of the 
animal-computer interaction lab
 at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

From high-tech wearable vests for dogs to a dog-friendly touchscreen that works like a telephone, Jackson and her colleagues at Georgia Tech are developing and testing new ways for canines to communicate with humans during a medical emergency.
Read More
Since last year, when 
CNN previously interviewed Jackson
 and her team, they have tested a touchscreen that dogs can use to call or text.
Dogs could be trained to activate a device if their owner falls or if they hear a verbal cue telling them to "get help," said Jackson, who founded the 
FIDO project at Georgia Tech
 to research ways to improve communication between dogs and humans.
"The dog could go over to a touchscreen and touch a series of icons on the touchscreen and call 911 with your location," she said. "We think that, literally, this could change lives, make lives so much better, and be a life-saver."
Teaching dogs to 'talk' with technology
Jackson, who also is a dog trainer, said that both companion pets and service dogs could easily be trained to use technology to communicate when their handlers need help.
"What we realized a few years ago is that service dogs and working dogs in general have a lot of information that they need to impart to their handlers," Jackson said.
"A medical alert dog may need to summon 911 for their person who is having a seizure. Or a military working dog might need to tell their handler what kind of explosive they just found," she said. "The dogs had no way reliably to do this. So we started focusing on technology to allow working dogs and specifically service dogs to communicate."
The mysterious science behind lifesaving dogs
Jackson and her colleagues have trained her border collie, Sky, and other dogs to approach a television-size touchscreen surface and use their noses to push three buttons when they hear the command "help."
Once the buttons are pushed, a computer connected to the touchscreen can be programmed to call anyone, such as a family member, a doctor or even 911, said Clint Zeagler, a research scientist and instructor at Georgia Tech, who has helped design the dog-friendly technologies for the FIDO project. 
The buttons on the touchscreen appear in blue and yellow because 
dog vision
 is somewhat similar to being red-green colorblind, Zeagler said. He added that there are three buttons on the screen to eliminate the chances of any accidental calls being sent if the dog bumps the screen once or twice by mistake.
5 things you don't know about service dogs
"What we're really doing with the FIDO project is looking at how can dogs best interact with technology," Zeagler said. "So, what size should the buttons be? What colors should the buttons be? What hardware should be used for dogs? We know those things for humans, but we're just starting to figure it out for a dog."
The researchers also have developed wearable technologies for dogs to use to communicate with humans. The wearables are designed as vests and are equipped with either a chew toy for the dog to bite on command or a braided rope for the dog to tug on command. Both actions activate a sensor in the toy or rope. 
Once activated, those sensors signal a computer in the back of the vest to make a phone call, send a text or even broadcast an audio message. An automated audio message, sent through a speaker on the vest, could let passers-by know that the dog has called for help or that the dog's handler needs more assistance.
Boy raises money for seizure alert dog
03:00
For instance, some seizure alert dogs are trained to sense the onset of a seizure, push their handlers against a wall to support their fall and then lick the face of their handlers during the seizure, Jackson said.
"But what if that dog could not just do all of that but reach around and tug a sensor on their vest that calls 911, with their GPS location, and also has a speaker that says, 'Excuse me, my handler is having a seizure; please stay back,' " Jackson said.
"We want to be able to let these dogs communicate with humans very specifically and very clearly so that even a person who isn't a dog trainer will understand what's going on," she said. "If the dog runs up to you and a speaker says, 'Excuse me, my handler needs your attention; can you please follow me,' OK, that's clear."
One 'ruff' day
Jackson also said that one of her former graduate students, Vincent Martin, and his guide dog Karson were in a situation a few years ago during which technology could have helped. Martin is blind.
"He was walking between classes one day on a very familiar path, and his dog stopped," Jackson said. "The dog wouldn't move, and so he took out his cane and he felt around. He couldn't feel anything."
Since Martin didn't feel anything in their path, Jackson said, he gave Karson a correction tug on the leash to encourage him to keep going. Karson reluctantly followed Martin's command.
"They both stepped into wet cement," Jackson said. "The dog had no way to tell him 'there's something in our path that I can't communicate to you.' "

Jackson and her colleagues hope that dog-friendly wearables and touchscreens soon could be commercialized for service animals around the world to use. Currently, the technologies are still research prototypes and have some limitations, Jackson said.
"We're working on, how do we make these more robust? How do you make the batteries last longer? How do you make this not false-positive, which means accidentally activate," Jackson said.
"These dogs love this work. The bond between a person and a service dog is unlike any other," she said. "We are just so proud that we can actually work in this area and hopefully create some of these technologies to keep that going."

All that separated Officer John Abbott from the deadliest attack on police since September 11, 2001, was a set of glass doors. 
And they were about to explode.
Abbott and Corporal Bryan Shaw, both of the El Centro College police department, rushed toward the exit of a school building to investigate the sound of gunshots outside the door.
 
"You could hear more automatic fire, rapid fire, clear as day," Abbott said. "That's when [the shooter] had us coming out the door to engage."

But before they could make it out, the bullets came to them.
"I saw Corporal Shaw double over a little bit, and the door in front of me exploded," Abbott said.
Wearing his bike uniform -- shorts and a yellow shirt -- Abbott slid backward and fell onto a bed of glass, embedding pieces into his arm and right leg below the knee. Getting up, he turned to Shaw and said what they both now realized: They were outgunned.
"I told him to get our rifles, cause it's a pistol battle against a rifle battle and you're going to lose every time," Abbott said.
Shaw could move, but felt discomfort underneath his bulletproof vest.

"I didn't feel pain, so I assumed it was glass," he said, not knowing that bullet fragments had skirted his vest and lodged in his side.
Neither man had time to care about their injuries. As Shaw went for the rifles and tactical gear, Abbott secured the door. Dallas police officers were outside advancing on the suspect, and as Shaw began to join them, he spotted an officer down.
"He was 20 feet away from the door. I got him, pulled him out of the line of fire and back into the building," Abbot said. "The moment I rolled him over I could see that he was my friend."
A 'fighter, warrior, hero'
Abbott had known Officer Brent Thompson from their days on the police force for Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART). He recalled working a Christmas night with Thompson and a group of officers who sat down at a restaurant together.
DART officer Brent Thompson was confirmed to be one of the fatalities in the Dallas police shootings in which 11 officers were shot during protests against police use of excessive force.
"He went around the table handing out gifts," Abbott said. "He was your friend. He wanted to be there for you if you needed something."
Now those roles were reversed; Thompson needed Abbott as he fought for his life.
"He had been shot in the head and we started to work on him," Abbott said. "We cut his clothes off and saw that he'd been shot in the chest."
Investigators later learned that Thompson had been shot from behind, ambushed as he rushed toward the sound of gunfire. He died at 8:58 p.m., two weeks after getting married to a fellow DART officer.
 "Brent was a fighter, warrior, hero, and quite the scrapper," said his wife, Emily Thompson, at her husband's funeral. "The kind of guy you want fighting with you."
They're the qualities Abbott summoned as gunfire again filled the air. The next sound he heard came from his radio. It was Shaw, who  was back inside, issuing a warning no one wanted to hear: "He's in the building!"
 The 'fatal funnel'
Along with being a police officer, Abbott is a military veteran currently in the Navy reserves. Prior to that, he completed six years of active duty, including tours in Iraq.
Black and blue: Double despair for African-American police
"This instance was very similar to Iraq," he admitted. Only this war zone was on home turf -- a terrifying thought, but also an advantage for Abbott and Shaw, who knew the layout of the building.
"We noticed a trail of blood going into the stairwell," Shaw said. Another officer "opens the door and we make entry, and I start receiving shots so I back out."
With Dallas police on the scene, Abbott, Shaw and three other El Centro officers split up to offer advice on the building's layout. Because El Centro's radio frequencies were different from those of Dallas police, Abbott was forced to improvise.
"I grabbed a Dallas sergeant's radio and said 'Look, if he's over here or he's on the mezzanine, he's got access this way. He's got this, he's got that," Abbott said. "And the sergeant said 'How do you know that?' And I was like, 'It's my building,' and he said 'Oh, we need to get you over here.'"
From that moment on, Abbott and an intelligence officer at an off-site command post offered tactical advice and hand-drawn maps to Dallas SWAT officers closing in on the suspect. They boxed him into a corner at the end of a hallway -- good for the public's safety, but tough for officers trying to end the siege.
From left, Officer John Abbott, Police Chief Joseph Hannifin and Corporal Bryan Shaw of the El Centro Community College police department.
"If officers entered, it is what they call a 'fatal funnel'," Abbott said, referring to a scenario where police have only one way in and out with no protection.
Hours of negotiations made it clear that the suspect, Micah Johnson, was not going to surrender. Dallas Police Chief David Brown later said Johnson told negotiators his goal was "to kill white people, especially white officers."
Brown authorized his team to take desperate measures: strap a pound of C4 explosive material to a robot and maneuver it against a brick wall. If it worked, the blast would blow the wall inward toward Johnson, killing him swiftly.
'Black, White and Blue: America 2016' town hall on a nation divided
"It's a common military tactic," Abbott said, but by all accounts, it was the first time a bomb-carrying robot was used by an American police force.
"This was the safest way," Shaw said in support of the decision. "No other officers were going to get hurt that way."
The bomb worked, ending the bloodshed, if not the tears shed for five officers killed during the gun battle.
'What I signed up for'
Along with DART officer Brent Thompson, four others lost their lives.
Dallas police Officer Michael Krol's lifelong dream was to be a police officer, his uncle told CNN affiliate WDIV. He texted his girlfriend earlier that evening from a march against police brutality to say "Everything has been peaceful."
What police -- and the policed -- need to do
Michael Smith, once a U.S. Army Ranger, joined the Dallas police in 1989. A family friend said he was so protective of his family that he "never drove his patrol car home." He leaves behind a wife and two daughters.
At six-foot five-inches, Dallas police Officer Lorne Ahrens was often called a "gentle giant." He practiced community policing and volunteered at his children's school.
Dallas Officer Patrick Zamarippa did three tours in Iraq only to be killed here at home. At 32 years old, the father of two was the youngest victim.
"They responded to the calls for help and they gave their lives," said El Centro police Chief Joseph Hannigan. "And yes, they're all heroes."
He includes his own officers, Abbott and Shaw, in that group even if they do not. 
Obama balances respect and frustration with police, protesters
"This is what I signed up for," Shaw said. "To protect people."
Shaw will eventually have surgery to remove the bullet fragments from his body, but said he'll be OK.
As for Abbott, his military background not only prepared him tactically, but also mentally, for the trauma he endured. "I'm just going to push on, keep doing what I'm doing," he said. Abbott deploys Saturday with the Navy to help build a runway in Alaska.
His wife, who outranks him as an officer in the military, didn't even know the extent of what her husband had been through until the next morning, Abbott said.

During the standoff he sent a text reading "I'm alive," and that "Everything's good." She said "Okay, I'm going to bed. Wake me up when you get home."
As she slept, Abbott knew he wouldn't be home anytime soon.  After getting medical treatment for his wounds, he sent his wife another text: "You're going to be up before I get home. I'll tell you about it later."

Paris (CNN)
French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has canceled a trip to the  COP24 global climate conference in Poland because of the riots in France, the Matignon Palace told CNN.
The decision comes as the French government said it was considering "all options" to control protests against rising fuel prices that have turned violent in Paris over the last three weeks, a spokesman said Sunday.  
Speaking on France's Europe 1 radio, spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said the government is thinking about steps to prevent "serious outbursts of violence," including introducing a state of emergency. 
More than 400 people were arrested and 133 injured in Paris on Saturday in clashes between police and protesters with the "gilets jaune" or "yellow vest" movement, who are protesting rising gas prices and taxes on polluting forms of transport.
An estimated 36,000 people demonstrated in 
Saturday's protests
 across the country, marking the third consecutive week of such demonstrations, according to the French Interior Ministry. About 53,000 participated last week and about 113,000 the week before.

Griveaux said that between 1,000 and 1,500 people joined Saturday's demonstrations "only to fight with the police, to break and loot." He added that those protesters "have nothing to do with the yellow vests."
Footage shared by French police on Saturday showed a few demonstrators striking a police vehicle and smashing its windshield. Other videos captured burning cars and police firing tear gas to disperse protesters.
Protesters and riot police clash during the "yellow vest" protests in Paris on December 1. 
French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner had mentioned a state of emergency, Griveaux said.
Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet told reporters at a Sunday press conference those involved in Saturday's protests would face "a very firm response from the criminal justice system." Some will be brought up for trial as soon as Monday, according to the minister.
Asked about the possibility of a state of emergency, Belloubet said, "I am not sure we have reached that stage quite yet. I think there are other options." 
French President Emmanuel Macron held an emergency meeting with top officials on Sunday just hours after returning from the G20 summit in Argentina. In a statement, Macron paid tribute to law enforcement and rescue teams who "showed unrelenting bravery throughout the day and evening." 
Macron also "stressed the importance of judicial follow-up so that none of the acts committed remains unpunished," the statement added. 
Tensions rising
Rising fuel prices are largely attributed to a leap in the wholesale price of oil worldwide.
But the protests have evolved into a broader demonstration against Macron, his government, and tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor.
Demonstrators with the "gilets jaunes" or "yellow vest" movement call for the French President Emmanuel Macron to resign at a demonstration last month.
Macron has borne the brunt of the demonstrators' anger instead of OPEC for reducing oil production, or the US for imposing tariffs on Iran, which crippled oil exports.
Many protesters are angry with Macron for extending the environmental policies that were first implemented by former President François Hollande.
Paramedics on Monday joined the list of anti-government demonstrators and went on strike to protest finance reforms in their sector.
Paramedics join anti-government protests outside the National Assembly in Paris.
The violent protests and vandalism in Paris have "absolutely nothing to do with the peaceful demonstrations of a legitimate unhappiness or discontent," Macron said on Saturday at a news conference in Buenos Aires, where he was attending the G20 summit.
Paris demonstrations could put Macron's future in jeopardy
"No cause justifies that security forces are attacked, shops pillaged, public or private buildings set on fire, pedestrians or journalists threatened or that the Arc de Triomphe is sullied," Macron said.
Those responsible will be identified and taken to court, he added. 
Upon his return to Paris on Sunday, Macron immediately visited the capital's Arc de Triomphe -- a flashpoint in Saturday's violent protests --  to "take stock of the damage" and pay tribute to the tomb of the unknown soldier at its base, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.
He also met with police officers and firefighters who worked to contain the protests, BFMTV said.

1. President Trump
Despite all the tough talk on his Twitter feed, President Donald Trump 
is worried he'll be impeached
 when the Democrats take over the House next month. A source close to Trump told CNN the President sees impeachment as a "real possibility." White House aides are more concerned about the federal investigation involving 
ex-Trump attorney Michael Cohen
 than Robert Mueller's Russia probe. While they don't believe Mueller's collusion investigation would lead to impeachment, they do worry that the Cohen case -- involving alleged campaign finance violations -- just might. So far though, Trump's allies in the GOP
 are just kind of shrugging at all of this
, and the President is convinced that even if he's impeached in the House, the GOP-led Senate wouldn't convict him.

2. Brexit
Theresa May will meet with European Union leaders today as the embattled British Prime Minister hopes to find a way 
to renegotiate her Brexit deal
. There was supposed to have been a vote on the deal today in Parliament, but 
May pulled it
 after it became apparent it would fail. And it's not clear her attempts at reworking it will work either, with some EU leaders already saying the current deal is the best one she's going to get. There's real talk now among some British lawmakers of holding a second Brexit referendum and real fear that the UK could tumble out of the EU in March without a deal, an outcome that could be 
disastrous for the British economy
.

3. Maria Butina
Accused Russian spy Maria Butina 
has a plea deal and is talking to the feds
, a source tells CNN. Butina was accused of 
infiltrating conservative organizations
 such as the National Rifle Association in advance of the 2016 election to advance Russian interests. She originally said she was just a foreign student interested in improving relations between the United States and Russia, but now she's apparently changed her tune. Butina's plea offer indicates she will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy when she has a "change of plea" hearing Wednesday before a federal judge, according to a copy of a document CNN obtained. It's still not clear how her case aligns with other ongoing Russian investigations or if she'll cooperate in other federal probes as part of her deal. After all the legal wrangling is over, she will likely be deported.

4. France
French President Emmanuel Macron says 
he is going to raise the minimum wage
 and ditch proposed new taxes on pensions. It's all a bid to stop 
the wave of violent protests
 that have washed over France in the past few weeks. In a nationally televised speech Monday, Macron said the protests by the 
"yellow vest" demonstrators
 are "unacceptable," but he also conceded the anger of the protesters is "just" and that people have "legit concerns." Macron's proposals could cost France as much as $10 billion. At times the protests have paralyzed parts of Paris, with landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower forced to close and some Metro stations shut. Sporting events across the country have also been called off.

The Big Tech scandals of this year roughed up the big boys like Facebook, but Google has remained relatively unscathed. But that might be about to change. 
Google CEO Sundar Pichai will testify
 on Capitol Hill for the first time when he meets this morning with the House Judiciary Committee. So what will he talk about? Oh there's lots, such as the recent admission that a bug in Google+ (no, it's not dead yet) 
revealed the private information of 52.5 million people
. Or maybe he can brief them on Google's controversial plan to create 
a censored search engine in China
. And Republican lawmakers will definitely want to talk to Pichai about their allegations that Google's actions and algorithms 
are biased against conservatives
Google CEO Sundar Pichai is set to testify Tuesday on Capitol Hill.

This image of Tempel 1 was taken by Deep Impact's camera 67 seconds after the probe hit the comet. Scattered light from the collision saturated the camera's detector and caused the bright splash seen in this image. The Deep Impact mission was supposed to end a few weeks later, but NASA approved an extension and renamed the spacecraft

Hong Kong (CNN)
Inspired by the French movement, Taiwan's own "yellow vest" protests are expected to continue on Saturday, with anti-tax demonstrators preparing to take to the streets again. 
Supporters of the Taiwanese Tax and Legal Reform League -- each donning a trademark "gilet jaunes" (yellow vest) -- first marched on Taiwan's Presidential Office in the capital Taipei on Wednesday.

It comes after "gilet jaunes" demonstrators took
 to the streets of Paris for weeks
 in occasionally violent protests that forced concessions on tax and other issues by French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this month. 
A league spokeswoman told CNN the march was aimed at pressuring the Taiwanese government to make the tax system more transparent. The group also protested the Ministry of Finance, for what they regard as an unfair policy of levying taxes and for delaying the implementation of tax exemption arrangements.
Protesters adopted the yellow garments made famous by anti-government protesters in France. 
The league was founded in 2016 and has been pressuring the government ever since -- but organizers said Wednesday's march marked the first time they had worn yellow vests.

"We were touched by the French movement, and decided to go to the streets in yellow vests," said the spokeswoman, who gave her surname as Wang. "We hope that (Taiwanese President) Tsai Ing-wen will listen to people's grievances and give concessions just like Emmanuel Macron did."
Wang said "unfair" taxation had deterred foreign businesses from investing on the island. The league's next protest will happen outside the Ministry of Finance headquarters in Taipei on Saturday.
The Ministry did not respond to a request for comment from CNN.

 (CNN)
Italy could soon be forced to import olive oil to stem a dramatic decline in production, a climate scientist has warned, as extreme weather events wreak havoc with harvests and threaten a shortage of one of the country's most essential culinary products.
Bad weather and frost have crippled the olive oil industry in recent months, causing a 57% drop in production over 2018 and costing the sector almost 1 billion euros ($1.13bn).
The fall has forced oil farmers onto the streets in protest this year, calling for aid and new measures to reverse the trend.
But extreme weather caused by climate change is likely to further damage the sector and could force Italians to look abroad for olive oil, according to Riccardo Valentini, director of the Impacts Division at the Euro-Mediterranean Center for Climate Change.
Climate change is not only influencing extreme weather events, it's causing them
"We are getting more and more into this complex climate situation of extremes," Valentini told CNN. "In terms of production, probably we can expect this [decline] occurring more and more, if we're not able to cope with this."
Read More
"Olive trees are very sensitive to certain climatic conditions -- sometimes three days of freezing [temperatures] are more important than an average temperature over the year," he added.
Europe has fallen victim to radical hot and cold weather events in recent years, which scientists say are often 
caused or exacerbated by man-made climate change. 
Italy was hit by a cold snap
 caused by the "beast from the east" in February 2018, before 
soaring heat swept the continent
 in the summer and strong 
winds and floods battered the Mediterranean nation
 in October. 
Olive oil farmers from Puglia, one carrying a sign reading "In love with our land," protest during this year's olive oil crisis in February.
"These experiences like freezing temperatures in the Mediterranean, or excess of water and heavy rains, but also the contrasts -- droughts, or high temperature -- are much more important than the average temperature."
Prices of olive oil 
jumped around 20% after a hot and dry summer
 caused a poor harvest across Europe in 2014. Two years earlier, oil was at record low prices after 
a bumper harvest.
 
"If this negative trend continues, there will be more [need] for importing oil from other countries," Valentini said. "Hopefully this won't happen -- but if this big trend carries on it may be the case."
'A big change to our lives'
Olive oil is a symbol of Italian cuisine and a staple produce across the country. While Spain is the world's largest olive oil producer, followed by Greece and Italy, oil is rarely imported into Italy from other countries.
"It will actually be a big change in our lives," said Valentini. "Italians have never used foreign olive oil ... it's very rare you find oil from other countries."
In February, oil farmers wearing orange vests -- intended to mimic the "yellow vest" movement in France -- took part in national protests calling for more financial support for the industry.
Olive trees infected by bacteria in Puglia in 2016.
The hit to production was labeled an "emergency" by Coldiretti, the country's largest farmers association, which said an "unprecedented employment crisis" had struck the sector.
"To tackle the emergency, targeted intervention is needed to allow producers hit hard by the frosts to start again," Coldiretti President Ettore Prandini said in a statement at the time.
Puglia, the southern region which produces most of the country's olive oil, was worst affected, with the region seeing a "real massacre of 25 million olive trees," according to the group.

 (CNN)
French President Emmanuel Macron has used his traditional New Year's Eve address to acknowledge the "anger" among anti-government protesters, but warned that hateful speech and actions would not be tolerated.
Speaking from the Elysee Palace on Monday, Macron said he would use that anger as a "lesson" for the new year ahead. 
Tax rises, yellow vests and a gold desk: Emmanuel Macron's humbling year
"An anger that came from far away broke out. Anger against injustices, against the course of globalization, sometimes incomprehensible, anger against an administrative system that has become too complex and lacking in benevolence," Macron said in his speech. "To me, this anger means one thing, whatever its excesses: we didn't resign ourselves."
The "gilet jeunes
"
 or "yellow vest" protests have paralyzed parts of France since erupting last month, as demonstrators clashed with police, torched cars, erected roadblocks and burned barricades.
The protests, named after the yellow high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their vehicles, have transformed from dissent over rising gas prices and eco-taxes into a broader demonstration against Macron, his government, and tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor.

Without naming the yellow vest protests directly, Macron railed against extreme and violent parts of the movement who claimed to speak "on behalf of the people" but were actually speaking for a "hateful crowd" to "attack officials, the police, journalists, Jews, foreigners, homosexuals." He called those elements, "the negation of France."
Macron said that France "wants to build a better future" but to do that, he said, people must respect each other and remember the lessons from the generations who fought for today's freedoms.

"We are free in our country only because generations before us fought not to suffer from despotism or any tyranny, and this freedom requires a republican order, he said. "It requires the respect of each and all opinions."
Under pressure to respond to the protests, Macron pledged in December to increase the minimum wage and scrap new pension taxes. But this move 
has done little
 to appease the anger felt by some hard-core protesters.
At the protests' height, 1,723 people were 
taken in for questioning
 and 1,220 were taken into custody over one weekend. On December 15, about 
34,000 protesters
 had turned out across France, including more than 2,000 in Paris, according to the Interior Ministry. The previous week, some 77,000 protesters demonstrated across the country, including 10,000 in Paris.
Emmanuel Macron was anointed as France's last great hope for reform. Is that all lost now?
Ten people have died in connection with the protests, with most deaths occurring in traffic accidents related to blockades in November and December, 
according
 to Le Parisien newspaper and CNN reporting.
The number of demonstrators has dwindled over the past couple of weeks, while authorities have ramped up policing to prevent a repeat of 
earlier violence
.
To get things back on track, Macron said France's "institutions must continue to evolve" and he vowed to "restore vitality to our democracy."

When Emmanuel Macron was still France's Economy Minister, he said French politics lacked the presence of a king -- "A King whom, fundamentally, I don't think the French people wanted dead," he said back in 2015.
With his political movement En Marche! (On the move)
 Macron won the French presidency in 2017
 and stepped into the monarchical void, landing a counter punch on the populist wave sweeping Europe. 
He gave his first address to both houses of parliament from the former seat of French kings, the gilded Palace of Versailles. The newly elected French President vowed to push through liberal reforms and restore France's dignity.
Eighteen months later, the new "monarch" faced a people's revolt. The Champs-Elysees, commissioned by Louis XIV, the so-called Sun King, was ablaze as 
protesters wearing yellow vests clashed with riot police
 and angrily chanted "Couper la tête du roi!" (cut off the king's head!). 
Emmanuel Macron was anointed as France's last great hope for reform. Is that all lost now?
The demonstrations laid bare France's deep divisions, between the urban elites and the rural poor, the winners and losers of globalization. How did the youthful "Jupiterian" leader -- who had upended the political status quo and sent entrenched politicians into early retirement -- find himself so out of touch? Did the fault lie with the technocrat courtiers he surrounded himself with, or was the public support never really there?

Although Macron did not rise to power through hereditary right, he does partly owe his throne to the far-right leader, Marine Le Pen. In the first round of the presidential election, Macron won just 25% of the vote. This result put him head to head with Le Pen in the second round. A great deal of support for Macron came from voters keen to keep the National Front leader out of office.  
One could argue that it wasn't his liberal agenda that won Macron the election -- it was fear of the alternative. Was this really a man of the people? 
Macron's privileged childhood was spent somewhat removed from the real world. Born into a wealthy family in Amiens, he was a bookish child who -- according to former classmates -- sought the company of adults rather than his peers.

Unlike his predecessors, Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande, who were politicized at a young age, a 20-something Macron was more likely to be engaged in deep conversation with the French philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, than out on the streets, going door to door, speaking to voters or local officials. 
Macron's career path screams globalist elite. He studied at France's most prestigious and selective school, Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) and aged 32, he became Rothschild's youngest investment banker. 
His meteoric rise gave Macron the belief that through hard work and perseverance he could do just about anything. Once elected, the dynamic French President wasted no time in applying his ambitious plan to reform his country, something others had tried and failed to achieve. 
Macron will need to do a lot more to silence the protestors
Macron successfully pushed through an unpopular rail reform, loosened labor rules, unapologetically slashed the wealth tax to encourage high earners to keep their money in France and promised to overhaul France's cherished welfare state. Critics quickly dubbed him"the president of the rich."
Over the summer, a series of awkward public interactions added to the image of an out-of-touch president. Three exchanges went viral, shocking the public, in the run up to the Yellow Vests protests. 
In June, he 
publicly berated a teenager for cheekily calling him by the nickname "Manu."
 In the clip, the floppy-haired boy is seen quickly apologizing to the president, who scolds him for several minutes. "You should call me Mr. President!" snaps Macron. The exchange was widely shared on social media, as users expressed sympathy for the teen and accused Macron of humiliating him.
Several months later, during a trip to Denmark, Macron was caught describing the French as "Gauls who are resistant to change." Opposition politicians back home said Macron was "insulting French identity" and showing "contempt" for his own people, while labor unions said the implication was that Gauls were mere commoners, "beneath the kings." 
Although Macron later acknowledged he had made a mistake, the damage was done.
Not long after, Macron drew the ire of France's job seekers, when, in September, he told a 25-year-old unemployed gardener he could easily find him work."There are loads of jobs, go on!" he said. "Hotels, cafes, restaurants -- I'll find you one just by crossing the road!" The image of the énarque (ENA) graduate schooling the young man provoked anger as critics took once more to Twitter, to denounce a president who was "out of touch with the people."

Macron's perceived condescending and arrogant behavior coupled with his liberalizing economic reforms fueled populist discontent as the year went on. 
Four weeks after Macron's interaction with the job seeker, Jacline Moraud, a 51-year-old from Brittany 
posted a short video on Facebook
, railing against the President over a proposed fuel tax hike. "What are you doing with the French people's money, Mr. Macron?" she asked several times. The video was watched more than 6 million times and Mouraud became one of the first unofficial spokespeople for the Yellow Vest movement. 
Six consecutive weekends of escalating violent protests saw thousands of people arrested, 
10 people killed
 and Paris' most expensive neighborhoods vandalized. "No Christmas for the bourgeoisie" was scrawled across the Arc de Triomphe, home to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
In a bid to assuage the fury of the Yellow Vests Macron gave a televised address. 
Sitting behind a gold desk he acknowledged he had "hurt people"
 with his words. He announced major concessions in the shape of financial aid to the least well off. The measures seemed to take the sting out of the revolt, and protests on Saturday were poorly attended.
How the Macron-Trump bromance evolved
01:51
The question for Macron now is whether he can win back the trust of the French people. Political analyst Dominique Moisi believes this will be hard. "Once you have humiliated people or once people have felt humiliated by you, it is difficult to recreate a process of confidence and trust," he says. 
Macron is now offering to listen to ordinary people. Along with the concessions, he announced a six-month consultation with mayors, local councilors, businesses, trade unions and the Yellow Vests to discuss economic reforms. But if Macron does manage to gain their trust how can he continue to reform? If Macron can't deliver a fuel tax hike, how can he see through other promised measures such as pension reform?

And what of Macron's bid to change the European Union? When he came to power German Chancellor Angela Merkel hoped the French President's ambition might breathe new life into the weakening bloc and yet today, he can barely even contain problems at home. Macron was also revered across the pond and 
his state visit to Washington in April 2017
 was the first of Dondald Trump's presidency. 
But as the "bromance" between the two leaders began to fade Trump took to Twitter to lambast Macron for his plan to "create a European Army." Clearly, the French president had fallen out of favor with the US president. 
Macron didn't seem to mind and he continued to present himself as the forthright and plain-speaking new leader of the free world. 
Addressing leaders at the centenary
 of the end of WWI last month, he warned, pointedly, "patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism."
Many saw his speech as an implicit dig at Trump who was forced to listen, stony-faced. Macron added that it was good to have 70 world leaders at the Arc de Triomphe for the memorial but asked how the photos would be seen in the future: "a symbol of lasting peace? Or the last moment of unity before the world falls into disorder?" 
Yellow vest protesters clash with riot police near the Arc de Triomphe, where weeks earlier, Macron addressed world leaders.
Popular revolt in Paris
Just three weeks later, the exact spot where Macron was lecturing the leaders, erupted into chaos as riot police filled the air with teargas and water cannons in a bid to disperse the rioters. People around the world watched in horror as Paris saw its worst civil unrest in more than a decade. With popular revolt taking hold, the king's troubles had just begun. 
Macron's reputation has taken a hit at home and on the world stage, particularly in Europe. It's hard to promote reform abroad when you can't reform at home. 
What's more, Macron's party could find itself competing with the Yellow Vests at a European level, as the protesters have vowed to field candidates in next year's European elections. Le Pen, who has tried to exploit the grievances of the Yellow Vests, could be the real loser, as
 polls suggest the far-right would lose a significant number of votes 
if the Yellow Vests put forward their own candidates. Ironically, the far-left, which has also constantly criticized Macron, would suffer the same fate.
When I met Emmanuel Macron in a TV studio just after he had debated Marine Le Pen and before the second round, he told me his favorite English text was "Le Roi Lear" -- Shakespeare's "King Lear." 
But if Macron fails to appease the Yellow Vests' anger -- to engage with the common folk, and to appear less imperious -- he could well fall victim to his own hubris, much like King Lear himself.

More than 40 years after pingpong diplomacy led to a thaw in Sino-American relations, it was on display again -- in rudimentary form -- as Michelle Obama visited a Beijing high school during her family's first full day of a visit to China.
At about 9:30 a.m., Obama -- accompanied by her daughters, Malia and Sasha, and her mother, Marian Robinson -- stepped from a black SUV onto a red carpet leading from the street to the entrance of Beijing Normal School, where they were greeted by China's first lady, Peng Liyuan, and ushered inside for a tour.

'Bad Boy' robot 'is really naughty'
When the robot got stuck, its student operator said something to the effect that it was nervous. "Don't be nervous," Obama said. "It's pretty impressive," she added as the robot was operating.
At another station, a young man showed Obama "Bad Boy," so named because the robot "is really naughty," he said, according to a pool reporter.
Obama agreed to try it, but could not get the remote control to work and handed it to Malia, who had better luck.
The first lady spoke with a number of students, asking a 16-year-old what she wanted to do after high school. "I want to turn mathematics into reality," the student answered.
When they arrived at a pingpong practice room containing six tables, an instructor asked Obama if she wanted to try her hand at it, and she quickly assumed the role of student.
"All right, wait," she said, taking off her vest. "How do I hold the paddle properly?"
"This is the angle," the instructor responded, holding it vertically.
"OK, we're going to get this," Obama said. "Let's go."
Armed with a paddle, she volleyed for about five minutes -- first with the instructor, then with a young woman, as students looked on. "Nice," she said occasionally after her opponent returned her shot.
But Obama acknowledged that she had little experience with the game. "My husband plays," she said. "He thinks he's better than he really is. I could stay here all day."
1971 pingpong match proved key 
The 50-year-old first lady was in grade school when a chance meeting by a Chinese pingpong player with a U.S. player led to Beijing's decision to invite the American table tennis team for an exhibition match in 1971.
That match laid the groundwork for the visit of U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1972 and paved the way for the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1979, ending China's isolation from the outside world.
As the members of the first family departed the school, 33 American exchange students -- one of them from Sidwell Friends, the Washington school attended by Malia -- lined up in front of the red carpet and across from their Chinese counterparts to shake hands with the family before they left for their next stop, the Forbidden City.

"Her visit and her agenda sends a message that the relationship between the United States and China is not just between leaders, it's a relationship between peoples," said Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes.
"That's critically important, given the roles that our two countries are going to play in the 21st century, that we maintain the very regular contacts that we have at the leader-to-leader level, but that we're also reaching out and building relationships with people, particularly young people."
U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at next week's Nuclear Security Summit at The Hague, Netherlands.
White House officials told reporters this week that the two leaders will discuss issues on which the United States and China differ, such as human rights and trade.
"We don't expect the people of China to agree with all of our policy positions at any given moment, but the more they understand the United States -- the more they understand the President and the first lady and their values and their priorities -- we think the better it is for both of our countries," Rhodes added.
China is the fifth most popular country for U.S. students studying abroad, and more students from China study in the United States than from any other country.

Paris (CNN)
When French President Emmanuel Macron won the presidential election in May 2017, beating Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right National Front, the markets heaved a sigh of relief.
The populist wave that had led the United Kingdom to vote to leave the European Union and that propelled Donald Trump to the White House appeared to have been stopped -- at least in France.  
Macron embraced this victory and presented himself as the new leader of the free world: a champion of a newly unfashionable multilateralist, globalist vision. 
Having changed the French political landscape with his candidacy, which he ran on the independent ticket "En Marche," Macron promised to fix Europe, fight climate change, stand up to the US and take on the populists gaining ground elsewhere in the EU.
So it is perhaps surprising that he should have been so slow to see the populist threat growing from within.

As the "gilets jaunes" or, "yellow vests" began appearing at roundabouts and toll booths around the country in early November, the government seemed deaf to the 
growing rumble of discontent
. The protests -- named for the yellow high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their vehicles -- began as a reaction to an eco-tax on gas but have since morphed into a much more political protest against Macron.
Even after some 282,000 people took the streets at the first mass yellow vest protest on November 17, it seemed that Macron had neither a clear strategy on what to do, nor even a grasp of the looming crisis.
Tax rises, yellow vests and a gold desk: Emmanuel Macron's humbling year
This reinforced the sense of a president out of touch with the common citizen, one insensitive to their plight. 
As one political analyst, Alexis Poulain, told me at the time: "Macron is the ultimate technocrat. He is at home in Davos. But here you have a man used to talking about millions of Euros, trying to listen to those counting in centimes. It cannot work."
Especially when those who count in centimes are suddenly calling the shots. 
After weeks of protests that turned violent, Macron eventually introduced some concessions. First, a cancellation of the tax increase that had sparked the movement. Then, a 10 billion Euro (approximately US $11.5 billion) package of social reforms, including an increase in the minimum wage, aimed at helping the purchasing power of those least well-off. 
But by then the damage was done.
The 
yellow vest movement
, having felt it was being ignored, now felt it was winning. So why stop? 
Last Saturday, on the first weekend of 2019, the numbers of yellow vest protestors demonstrating on the streets were back up from the week prior, a suggestion that the yellow vests aren't done yet.
But while the movement has stayed strong, it has changed in its focus and is now looking to change in its form. 
From a fiscal revolt, to a battle over spending power, the yellow vest movement is now calling for more power to be given to "the people" through mass popular votes or "referenda d'initiative citoyenne" (RIC). 
Emmanuel Macron was anointed as France's last great hope for reform. Is that all lost now?
Next week, in yet another concession toward 
the protesters
, Macron will send a letter to the public, outlining the themes of a big national debate. 
The topics of that debate will span from spending power to the functioning of the institutions and climate change initiatives.
But even before that debate begins, the government has already ruled out a U-turn on Macron's reform agenda or institutional reform. 
So, what can emerge if not dissatisfaction with the debate, argue some observers of French politics who warn of the dangers involved in the process itself.
By placing himself in a dialogue with "the people," they say, Macron -- having already destabilized France's representative democracy by the very nature of his candidacy -- risks now taking on a mob that could yet force the dissolution of parliament and a set of legislative elections.  
Meanwhile, some yellow vests have already decided to go into politics themselves, and are now preparing candidacy lists for the European elections this May. An Ipsos poll, ordered by Macron's party, showed those candidates could potentially win about 12% of the vote, mainly at the expense of the far-right and far-left.
Macron has long warned that he expects that poll to be decisive to the future of Europe. 
Le Pen's far-right party 
is currently leading voting intentions in France. Other European populists, many of them Eurosceptics, are also expected to do well in May's election.
Now, another populist force looks set to enter the European Parliament, becoming a new force and feature of the political landscape in France.
Far from putting an end to the populist wave, Macron appears to have overseen its expansion.

It began as a movement among a few people in lower middle-class rural France protesting a new eco-tax on fuel they felt would push their budgets over the edge.
But as France locks down in preparation for a possible fourth weekend of violent protests, the movement of "gilet jaunes," named after the yellow high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their vehicles, has morphed into a movement of many colors, with extremist groups jumping on the bandwagon.

The demands have also expanded, with even students taking part, calling for changes to the French high school examinations and university entrance procedures.
Also among the protesters are anarchists, elements of the anti-immigration populists and hard-core fascists. There are even groups on social media claiming to be environmental "yellow jackets," a direct contradiction of the original protesters' demands to scrap a new eco-tax. 
Action coordinated on Facebook
Read More
Much of the organizing for the protests has taken place on Facebook. According to the social media company's own figures, 67% of French people use Facebook, with 22 million people logging on every day. 
The protests have been coordinated through groups called "groupes colères," or "angry groups," which have amassed hundreds of thousands of members over the course of this year. 
The biggest Facebook group is the "Compteur Officiel de Gilets Jaunes" or official yellow jacket count, which boasts 1.7 million members. Another group is the "Carte des Rassemblements," which means rally or demonstration map, with 300,000 members.  A more sinister-sounding group, "Angry Patriots," has 53,000 members. 
Leading 'gilets jaunes'
The original "yellow vest" was the motor mechanic Ghislain Coutard, 36, from Narbonne in southern France. Nicknamed "vestman" on social media, a video he produced encouraging people to show their opposition to the tax by wearing a yellow jacket quickly went viral, with 5.4 million views. 
Another social media "gilet jaune" popular with the media is Jacline Mouraud, 51, a hypnotherapist and accordion player from Brittany.
She is part of a group called the "Free Yellow Vests," who are calling for demonstrators to stay away from Paris because of what they say is a "trap" set up by the government, which they accuse of pursuing "a strategy of chaos."
"I don't see the point in marching on Paris, that is a piece of theater. This is not a game, everyone needs to understand now, everyone needs to realize what we have achieved and the fact we have been given the right to discuss," she told French newspaper Le Parisien. 
A recent favorite with the media is 
Jean-François Barnaba
, 62, a former director of culture and tourism in Indre, a department in central France, who was removed from his post and placed on extended "gardening leave" on 80% of his salary, 10 years ago.
Barnaba currently receives $2,900 dollars a month, which he says leaves him with just $1,000 a month to support his wife and seven children after all the bills are paid. 
According to the AFP news agency, Barnaba wrote and self-published a novel in 2016 and has given more than 30 interviews to French media on behalf of the "yellow vest" movement.
Éric Drouet, 33, a lorry driver from Melun in the south-eastern suburbs of Paris with 47,000 Facebook followers, started a "yellow vest" movement in his local automobile club, the Muster Crew, according to Le Monde newspaper.
He told CNN affiliate BFMTV on Wednesday: "Saturday will be the final goal. Saturday it's the Elysée (presidential residence). We would all like to go to the Elysée. It will really be Saturday. We are all united to the end and we move on the direction of l'Elysée."

However, in a Facebook video published later, Drouet damped down the angry tone. "I ask people to come out to demonstrate, not to smash things up," he said in the video. "I want to go to the Elysée not to break it, but so we get listened to." French media reported Friday he was now being investigated by the public prosecutor. 
An associate of Drouet is Priscillia Ludosky, 33, who runs an online perfume company from the south-east Parisian suburbs. She became another "yellow vest" figurehead after starting an online petition to call for lower fuel prices that collected more than a million signatures. 
Ludosky says she is against all political parties, but on Thursday published a political manifesto calling for, among other things, popular referendums, the creation of a people's assembly, a cut in the salaries of public officials as well as a curb on their expense accounts. A black woman, many of her Facebook followers come from France's non-white communities.
To the right of the movement is Maxime Nicolle, 31, otherwise known as Fly Rider, whose posts have been viewed by hundreds of thousands of people, according to Le Monde. Sporting a red beard and baseball cap turned backward, he is something of a conspiracy theorist. He is associated with the online blogger and conspiracy theorist Étienne Chouard, who first became known in France 13 years ago when he called for a referendum over the European Union constitution. 
Nicolle is credited with spreading fears that Macron is preparing to sign a United Nations agreement to allow 480 million more immigrants into Europe. On a recent Facebook video post, seen below, he was advising people to stock up on food and to secure their homes in case of looting and called on the forces of law and order to defend "the people against the government." 
"I'm definitely not backing down now," he told CNN Wednesday, following the suspension of the new fuel tax. "The moratorium (on the fuel tax) is useless. The people want a referendum, a referendum on Macron, the senate and the national assembly."
His Facebook page was down on Friday. 
The concern now, and the reason for the strong police mobilization Saturday, is the hijacking of the "angry groups" by violent political extremists. 
"These past three weeks have seen the birth of a monster that has escaped its creators," Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told a press conference Friday.

From North Korea and China, across Russia and Europe, world leaders this holiday season have been raising both direct and oblique challenges to the United States. Above all, these messages should give Trump pause before he continues what is promising to become a headlong slide into an abyss of isolation. 
David A. Andelman
Most of the leaders, especially those heading democracies around the world, understand how far Trump has drifted from the traditional American values that have so long been prized abroad. If Trump listens carefully to these New Years' messages from democrats as well as autocrats, and is able to make informed decisions that may help form stronger alliances -- while seizing opportunities to stand strong against threats to American interests -- he may perhaps find a path out of the wilderness into which he has plunged his presidency and the American people.
North Korea
Six months after Kim Jong Un met with President Donald Trump in Singapore and signed a vague pledge agreeing to work toward complete denuclearization in exchange for lifted sanctions, the two countries 
remain deadlocked
 on how to achieve this. On Tuesday, Kim issued a televised address from Pyongyang -- where the new year arrived 14 hours ahead of Washington -- and wasted no time throwing down the gauntlet.
"If the US does not keep the promises it made in front of the world, misjudges the patience of our people, forces a unilateral demand on us, and firmly continues with sanctions and pressures on our republic, we may be compelled to explore new ways to protect our autonomy and interests, and establish peace and stability on the Korean peninsula," Kim 
said
.

Trump says they are still working to set up 2nd Kim Jong Un meeting
Clad in a dark western suit, Kim sat on a leather sofa in front of a fireplace with portraits of his father and grandfather behind him and said he'd be delighted to meet with Trump a second time. But Kim would leverage a meeting to demand -- either as a precursor for negotiations or a necessary condition for disarmament -- the end of US sanctions and the withdrawal of American forces from South Korea. 
It will be worth watching to see how Trump's new Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan might react to the prospect of American withdrawal, if the President were foolish enough to even consider such a proposal without solid proof of progress toward an end to the North Korean nuclear program.
China
In his 
New Year's message
, Chinese President Xi Jinping avoided any direct mention of the tariff war with the United States, and pledged to push ahead with his Belt and Road development, which will stretch from Asia to Europe and into Africa, and promote trade.
New acting secretary of defense tells Pentagon 'to remember China, China, China'
In addition to the ambitious multi-billion dollar initiative -- which is seen as a major challenge to American interests as China wrestles for global dominance -- Xi said, "Looking at the world at large, we're facing a period of major change never seen in a century. No matter what these changes bring, China will remain resolute and confident in its defense of its national sovereignty and security." In short, Xi is pushing a "China first" agenda, and posing quite a challenge to Trump's "America first" strategy.
Xi did also send a 
separate message
 to Trump that appeared somewhat more conciliatory. The United States and China are counting down the days until the end of the 90-day trade war truce that was agreed upon last month, and Apple is already warning investors about 
slowing iPhone sales
 in China, which CEO Tim Cook blamed in part on "rising trade tensions."
In 2019, the struggle to save democracy will face its key tests
Xi pointed out that "history has proved that cooperation is the best choice for both sides," and Trump responded that it was his priority to promote constructive US-Chinese relations, according to the official Chinese news agency Xinhua. The two leaders also spoke by telephone, and Trump characterized their conversation as a "long and very good call," before adding that the trade talks were progressing well. 
If Trump and Xi can't find a way to resolve their trade war in 2019, there will be consequences far beyond the dangerous economic landmines of such an impasse. And while Xi's message was addressed to his own people, it's clear that Trump will face challenges from Beijing as China will continue trying to muscle its way toward global dominance -- as well as regional dominance in the South China Sea, which carries about 
a third
 of global shipping.
France and Germany
Both the leaders of France and Germany faced serious questions regarding their leadership this past year, and both President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Angela Merkel used their annual messages to reassert themselves yet again in sharp contrast to Trump.
France's Emmanuel Macron calls for respect and unity in New Year's speech
Macron delivered a law-and-order message to his people, amid ongoing "yellow vest" demonstrations against his economic and social policies. The French leader, who has appealed frequently for an end to nationalism, 
, "We are free in our country only because generations before us fought not to suffer from despotism or any tyranny, and this freedom requires a republican order. It requires the respect of each and all opinions."
This isn't the first time Macron and Trump have expressed differing views. The US President previously blasted Macron for his push for a 
European defense force
. Just last week, Macron 
spoke out
 about the need for France and Europe to remain in Syria and battle ISIS.
In what appears to be a veiled rebuke of Trump's foreign policy strategy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, "We will only master the challenges of our times if we stick together and collaborate with others across borders." Though effectively a lame-duck leader, having lost her leadership of the ruling Christian Democratic Union with plans to 
step down
 when her current term as chancellor ends in 2021, Merkel 
told her people
, "We are committed to a more robust, more decisive European Union," adding that nationalism remains the leading threat to the international order.
Why President Macron's U-turn is a warning for climate leaders
Merkel also appeared to take swipes at Trump as she suggested that climate change, managing migration and combating terrorism required international cooperation. "We want to resolve all these questions in our own interest, and we can do that best if we consider the interests of others," she 
. "That is the lesson from the two world wars of the last century. But this conviction is no longer shared today by everyone, and certainties of international cooperation are coming under pressure."
European leaders seem increasingly prepared to break from Trump and all he represents. Trump will have a hard time in the new year amid increased support for a European defense force, as well as a determination to retain a foothold in the Middle East. Trump is also likely to face challenges on climate change and 
sanctions on Iran
Russia
President Vladimir Putin set up a series of difficult challenges to the international order in a host of bilateral messages to world leaders including Trump, Syria's Bashar al-Assad, and Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan. "Through their joined efforts, Moscow and Ankara are making a decisive contribution to fighting terrorism in Syria and advancing the process of political settlement in that country," according to a press release from the 
Kremlin
, describing Putin's letter to Erdogan.
US ambassador to Russia visits detained US citizen Paul Whelan
At the same time, he promised Bashar he would "continue to provide all-round assistance to the government and people of Syria in their fight against terrorism and efforts to protect state sovereignty and territorial integrity," the press release 
states
This suggests that in the new year, Putin intends to cement his dominance throughout the region as Trump prepares America's withdrawal.
Separately, to Trump, Putin proposed a summit conference in the new year with an extensive agenda.
In his broader message to his own people, Putin urged that they work together to improve the quality of life in Russia. He 
, "We never had any help in these endeavors, and never will," an apparent suggestion that they should look to no early end to sanctions that continue to cripple the Russian economy.

All these New Year's messages make it clear that this is not the time for impulsive or ill-considered decisions. How Trump responds to these challenges -- and how deeply he understands and navigates the powerful forces at work across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe -- will determine the fate of the United States over the next year.

 (CNN)
France has recalled its ambassador from Italy for consultations over "unprecedented" and "repeated" criticism by Italian officials, the French foreign ministry said in a statement Thursday. 
"For several months, France has been the target of repeated criticism, baseless attacks and outrageous declarations that everyone knows about," it said.
"This is unprecedented since the end of the war. To have disagreements is one thing, to exploit the relationship for electoral aims is another."
In the statement, Paris said the criticisms "create a serious situation that questions the intentions of the Italian government with regards to its relationship to France."
The decision to recall the ambassador comes one day after a spokeswoman for the French foreign ministry said it was "unacceptable" that Italian Deputy Prime Minister Luigi di Maio met with France's 
yellow vest anti-government protesters. 
Leader of Italy's populist Five Star Movement Luigi Di Maio inflamed tensions between France and Italy after meeting French anti-government  protesters.

"This latest provocation is unacceptable between neighbors and EU partners," the foreign ministry spokeswoman said, adding that di Maio "must be careful not to undermine our bilateral relationship through repeated acts of interference."
Di Maio posted a picture of him in France with

leader Christophe Chalençon and European parliament election candidate Ingrid Levavasseur, and said that "the wind of change has crossed the Alps."

The war of words between the two countries began last summer, when French President Emmanuel Macron warned that populism was "spreading like leprosy." Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini hit back in January, calling Macron a "very bad president" and saying that he was to blame for the yellow vest protests.

Sixty people, including 17 police officers and a fireman, were slightly injured on the 18th straight Saturday of yellow vest demonstrations in Paris.
Protests turned violent as police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the crowd. Protesters threw rocks and set up barricades.
A spokesman for Paris police said 192 people were being held for questioning. The Paris prosecutor's office said 64 have been placed in custody.
Protesters torched a branch of the Tarneaud bank, a spokesperson for Paris firefighters said. Firefighters evacuated the building and put out the blaze.

On the Champs-Élysées, stores and restaurant windows were shattered and a newspaper stand was set on fire. Fouquet's, the restaurant where former President Nicolas Sarkozy celebrated his election in May 2007, was among the vandalized establishments.

The restaurant's windows were smashed, its awning burned and its insides wrecked. Protesters used spray paint to write "Sarkozy has broken everything" on the restaurant's outside wall.
Fouquet's restaurant on the Champs-Élysées in Paris was heavily damaged in the yellow vest protests Saturday.
"No doubt: they are calling for violence and are here to wreak havoc," French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner tweeted Saturday as the clashes unfolded. "Professionals of damage and disorder, equipped and masked, have infiltrated the protests. My instruction to the police: Respond very firmly to these unacceptable attacks."
The 
"gilets jaunes"
 or yellow vest protests began as a campaign against a gas tax hike, but have morphed into a broader rally against President Emmanuel Macron's government.
French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, during an interview with CNN affiliate BFM on Saturday, said those who "excuse or encourage" the ongoing protests are "complicit." 
Philippe said authorities are working to ensure those responsible will be "put before the tribunal and be severely punished." 
"Our objective is one of total firmness," Philippe said, adding that there are thousands of "very determined people who are there to create disorder and to commit the acts I have just denounced."

Bourgtheroulde, France (CNN)
I'm sure you've heard the old bromide attributed to Charles de Gaulle, who wondered how it was possible to govern a country like France, with its 246 different kinds of cheese. 
These days, Emmanuel Macron is discovering the complexity de Gaulle was talking about as he confronts the myriad demands of his constituents in an effort to mollify the "gilets jaunes," or "yellow vest" movement. 
He's calling it Le Grand Débat -- the Great Debate. A chance over the next two months for everyone in France to get their gripes off their chests. 
Macron vowed to fight the populists. Now he's being engulfed by them
Shortly before Macron's visit to Normandy to launch Le Grand Débat, I received a lecture on "individualism" from a yellow-vested protester at a roundabout known colorfully as the Rond-Point des Vaches -- the Roundabout of Cows. (A side note: in France, "la vache!" is a mild curse, as well as a metaphor for obedient taxpayers who are constantly being pushed around and milked). 
"No one is in charge here," protester Olivier Bruneau, a 42-year-old factory worker, told me. "But everyone has a reason for joining in the movement." Welcome to Normandy.
Read More
The Rond-Point des Vaches has been occupied continuously from the very beginning of the Yellow Vest movement by "individualists" huddled around burning piles of wooden transport pallets. Each has a slightly different set of reasons for being here.  
As Denis Lacorne, senior research fellow at the prestigious Sciences Po, told me, "The Yellow Vest protests create a kind of artificial, but real, solidarity among protesters. They're isolated in their rural settings and suddenly they meet people like them, make friends and have a good time."
A car driver shows his yellow vest to cheer protesters as French President Emmanuel Macron visits Normandy on Tuesday.
Why here? I asked Bruneau. Well, he patiently explained, it is a place of maximum visibility for trucks passing from the coast through Normandy to other parts of France and Europe -- traffic that the protesters can easily block from time to time, creating impressive traffic jams.  
And as the protesters wreak havoc, they also spread the movement by explaining to one driver after another how aggrieved they are ... and encouraging them to put their own yellow safety vests in the windows of their cabs in solidarity. This is one protest that is wonderfully easy to join -- take out the safety vest everyone is obliged to have in their vehicle and the movement spreads.
What's more, who could be against a movement in which the chief complaint is the decline in buying power? Is there anyone in France who could be in favor of that?  And few would disagree that the 
far-off Paris government
 seems indifferent to the financial plight of those in the countryside. The response from the top has been slow -- and, some say, condescending. "Let them eat cake" had its origins here, after all. 
France's Emmanuel Macron calls for respect and unity in New Year's speech
President Macron chose Bourgtheroulde, a small town of 3,800 inhabitants, just down the road from Le Rond-Point des Vaches to kick off his Great Debate. 
It was the start of two months of talking over the concerns of the little guy; the President hoping, perhaps, to head off further protests by either addressing or appearing to address these concerns. Two months to search for a national consensus. And in spite -- or, perhaps, because -- of that individualism Bruneau talked about, the French are masters at building consensus. 
You see it everywhere, from the town hall to the workplace. If you want things to move along smoothly, you don't just issue orders from the top down but patiently find agreement and commonality from the bottom up.    
This was the reason for the trip to Normandy, the reason the President met with the local mayors, who are more in touch with those on the ground and in the streets. For centuries before anyone ever conceived of Le Grand Débat, mayors in France have maintained "complaint books" in their town halls so average citizens could come in and write down what's bugging them.  
Mayors have collected thousands of different grievances since the Yellow Vest movement began and many brought them along to share with Macron. 
The President came to listen -- perhaps because he knows that, in France, when you give everybody a chance to express themselves, it is much more difficult for them to later turn around and disown the collective decisions. They become part of a consensus built by the President rather than one constructed by the yellow vests.  
The only problem for Macron is that in France these days there are at least as many complaints as there are cheeses.

"I was the person who faced the riot police on Saturday, January 5. I wanted to explain things my way," he said.
"I love my country and I am patriotic. But, after being hit again and again, I was also gassed on the last day," Dettinger added. "Yes, the anger started building and I reacted badly. But I defended myself."
The French Boxing Federation called the behavior "unacceptable and shameful."
The Federation, as well as the National Professional Boxing League, "strongly condemns such acts of extreme violence that are totally contrary to the values ​​advocated by our discipline," the federation said in a statement.
Gilets jaunes
Unrest erupted across France on Saturday in the latest Gilets Jaunes, or "yellow vest," protests.  Around 50,000 people demonstrated, Castaner said. Large gatherings were held in Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles.
'Yellow vest' protests across France trigger spurts of violence, calls for calm
The protests are named after the yellow high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their vehicles.
They have morphed from dissent over rising gas prices and eco-taxes into a broader demonstration against President Emmanuel Macron and his government, and tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor.
In December, Macron pledged to increase the minimum wage and get rid of new pension taxes, a move that didn't appease the anger of some of the protesters.

New security measures in place at Mogadishu airport in wake of bombing, Somali official says
 (CNN)
The explosive device built into a laptop computer that detonated last week on a Somali passenger jet was "sophisticated" and got past X-ray machines at the Mogadishu airport, a source close to the investigation told CNN, raising concerns about security measures at airports across Africa and internationally. 
The device blew 
a hole in the skin of the Daallo Airlines plane on February 2
 but did not down the aircraft, because it detonated 20 minutes into the flight, before it reached cruising altitude. The suspected bomber was blown out of the plane, and his body was recovered on the ground near Mogadishu. The plane returned to the airport. Two people aboard were injured. 
Investigators suspect 
Abdullahi Abdisalam Borleh, a Somali national
, carried the laptop computer with a bomb in it onto Daallo Airlines Flight 159, the source said. The bomber knew precisely where to sit and how to place the device to maximize damage, the source told CNN. Given the placement, the blast likely would have set off a catastrophic secondary explosion in the fuel tank if the aircraft had reached cruising altitude, the source said. 
But an hour delay in the departure of the flight may have saved everybody on board, the source said.

The source said two airport workers, who became suspects in the plot, put the laptop on an X-ray belt and then handed the device to the suspected bomber in the departure lounge.

A military grade of the explosive TNT caused the explosion on the Somali airliner, two other sources with knowledge of the investigation told CNN, citing an initial analysis of residue recovered from the aircraft. 
Experts told CNN it was unlikely a forensic examination of the airplane would so quickly have provided clues about the sophistication of the device because the laptop was blown into many pieces. They said the most likely explanation for such a quick assessment was that investigators were able to look at a saved copy of the X-ray scan.  
A Somali official told CNN that a piece of the keyboard from the laptop and the laptop bag, although burned, survived the explosion. 
The airport worker wearing a white shirt in the surveillance footage died in mysterious circumstances three days after the attack when a vehicle he was in exploded, a Somali official close to the investigation told CNN. Just before the explosion, the person to whom the vehicle belonged -- the man in a yellow vest in the surveillance video -- had gotten out of the car so he could buy something at a shop. He was taken into custody, according to the official. 
The same official backtracked from his earlier assertion that both airport workers were arrested.
Lax standards in security 'elephant in the room'
It was not clear what kind of X-ray machine failed to detect the explosive device nor whether the laptop was subject to other explosive detection systems. Most airports in the developed world use the latest generation of multiview X-ray machines, but some airports in less developed parts of the world still use single-view X-ray machines significantly less reliable in detecting explosives.
Many airports in Africa and across the developing world also lag behind in the deployment of explosive trace detection technology, or ETD. In a practice familiar to many air travelers, security staff take swabs that are placed into a machine and can detect minute quantities of explosive residue. 
The latest generation of X-ray machines and ETD, when used in combination, are generally good at detecting TNT and should catch the explosive, even if it were concealed in the electronics of a laptop, because ETD swabs can detect minute amounts of residue, according to William McGann, an explosive detection expert at Implant Sciences, a U.S. company that manufactures explosive detection systems.
McGann told CNN that when modern multiview X-ray systems are used alone there is a chance the clutter in the X-ray image caused by the laptop could lead operators to overlook anomalies flagged by the technology. "Single view X-rays, on the other hand, would be totally reliant on a very vigilant screener at best --  and TNT concealed in a laptop could be easily missed," he added.
Lax standards in airport security across Africa and in many developing nations across the world has been the "elephant in the room for a long, long time," an explosives expert with experience in Somalia told CNN on condition of anonymity. 
"When terrorists start changing their methods to the point where their explosive devices are no longer just a bag of bolts or a steel pipe, then the rest of the world needs to be worried. These sorts of disguised devices are disturbing. A perpetrator may not fool the world-trained expert looking at the device on an X-ray, but a half-bored official without the same training might let something slip by. They are starting to defeat visual technology. It's only as good as the operator," the expert said. 
Robert Liscouski, a former senior official at the Department of Homeland Security and president of Implant Sciences, said there's an urgent need for better training of airport workers. 
"In developing countries where there are significant challenges to training and maintaining an effective security workforce, it is almost impossible to have a security system that won't have process vulnerabilities," Liscouski said.
One avenue of inquiry for investigators will be whether the laptop received less scrutiny by staff manning the X-ray machine because airport workers brought it in. 
Somali investigation called open
The Somali government has been open and cooperative with its international partners in the investigation so far, a Western official in Mogadishu said. 
Jangali, the Somali transport minister, told CNN the investigation was progressing well. 
"Hopefully when we conclude the investigation, we can share this information we have gathered with other intelligence agencies," he said by phone. "It's too early to speculate on the exact nature of this attack. We first want to find out exactly what happened, the sequence of events and all the people involved to get the complete picture." 
Laptop used in earlier attack
If the Somali terrorist group 
Al-Shabaab
 built the explosive device in the plane bombing, it would represent a significant elevation in its bomb-making capabilities, according to analysts. Given the sophistication of the device, one possibility is that al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen -- al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- shared technology with the group. 
AQAP bomb-maker Ibrahim al Asir
i has been developing a new generation of explosive devices concealed in electronics, according to Western intelligence officials, and there are indications the group has shared this technology with al Qaeda affiliates in Syria. 
Last week's explosion in the air above Somalia wasn't the first case of a laptop bomb being used to try to target civilians in the Somali capital. 
A laptop explosive device was used in a 2013 attack on a Mogadishu hotel. 
In November 2013, Al-Shabaab deployed a laptop bomb at the city's Hotel Maka. 
A confidential source close to that investigation at the time provided photos of the device, saying they show that the bomb was faulty. The incomplete detonation, however, led people in the hotel to run outside the building, and when first responders arrived, a suicide bomber drove a car bomb into the group, killing six and injuring more than a dozen. 
More than 40 arrests so far, official says
Al Qaeda affiliate believed to be behind laptop bomb 
01:57
No group has claimed responsibility for the Daallo plane attack. U.S. officials said Al-Shabaab is the most likely culprit. The terror group attacked a restaurant and hotel last month on Mogadishu's Lido Beach, killing dozens of Somalis. 
A Somali official close to the investigation told CNN that three field tests for explosives were conducted at the explosion site on the plane. All tested positive for explosive residue. Now those tests have been sent to labs in the United States. 
According to the official, Borleh, the suspected bomber, was seated in 16 F on the plane. Investigators found parts of the laptop -- a piece of keypad -- and the laptop bag burned. The explosive device was hidden inside the laptop. The plane was at 12,000 feet when the explosion occurred. Borleh's right leg and right hand were blown off -- leading investigators to believe the bag was somewhere on his right side.  
The source said Borleh's injuries were consistent with those suffered in an explosion, and he had explosive residue on him when his body was recovered. Borleh was heading to Turkey, ostensibly for medical reasons. He ended up taking the Daallo Airlines flight to Djibouti after a Turkish Airlines flight he had booked was canceled. 
There have been 45 arrests made so far in the case, and those are some people who were directly and indirectly involved, the Somali official said. 
Somalia's criminal intelligence division and explosive ordinance disposal team are leading the investigation. People are being interrogated, surveillance footage is being combed through from the 92 closed-circuit TV cameras at the airport, the official said.
"We have minute-by-minute footage of the event," the official told CNN.

Somalia has begun using new search and security methods at the Aden Adde International Airport in Mogadishu, including bomb-sniffing dogs, says Ali Ahmed Jama Jangali, the Somali transport minister. 
Passengers said sniffer dogs were now searching their luggage at the airport. These dogs are not new; they are part of the Somalia National Police's explosive ordinance disposal teams. 
Until now these canines and their Somali handlers have been deployed at big events or during VIP visits -- but Jangali said they would become a regular feature at the Mogadishu airport.

President Trump calls for unity 
Lawmakers and their families picnic on the South Lawn
Washington (CNN)
Lawmakers took a rare break from bitter partisan politics and went to the White House Thursday evening for a good old-fashioned picnic.
President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump hosted the Congressional Picnic, a bipartisan, annual event on the South Lawn aimed at bringing members of Congress, their families and members of the administration together for a casual, lighthearted evening.
"We've gotten to know many of you over the last weeks and months, and developed many friendships with politicians," Trump said in brief remarks to lawmakers. "Can you believe it? Some really great people, I have to say, mostly. Mostly. A couple of bad ones, but that's OK."

The picnic may have been a welcome respite after a day filled with deep partisan disagreements on Capitol Hill 
following the release of the GOP Senate health care bill draft
, as well as a particularly divisive Georgia election earlier this week that left the President taking a victory lap and some Democrats calling for the ouster of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. 
'We owe it to the American people'
Instead of stoking those divisions, however, Trump called for unity in the aftermath of last week's shooting at a congressional baseball practice that left the Republican House whip, Rep. Steve Scalise, critically wounded. Trump confirmed that he had hoped to attend the next day's baseball game between Republican and Democratic lawmakers, but was told by the Secret Service that it would be difficult.
"It's our hope that this unity that was displayed that evening can maybe continue to grow and thrive between Republicans and Democrats," Trump said in his remarks. "And I think, honestly, I think we'd all be doing a lot better, and I know the country would be doing a lot better."
"Maybe it's too early," he went on. "Maybe the wounds are too deep in terms of the relationship, because it's been bad for a long time, a long time. Not just when we got there. I mean, this has gone on for many years. And hopefully those wounds can heal, and heal quickly, because we owe it to the American people."
The first lady, who is known to do extensive research and homework ahead of White House events, planned the picnic with a focus on bringing people together in this political climate. 
Melania Trump finds her way in her first 100 days
"My husband and I are pleased to welcome members of Congress and their families to the people's house," the first lady said in a statement. "With the recent and tragic shooting at the congressional baseball game practice last week, it is more important than ever that we spend time together not as politicians, but as colleagues and friends."
"Especially with the tragedy of last week, she wanted it to be a family atmosphere where it could be as bipartisan as possible," Stephanie Grisham, the first lady's communications director, told CNN. "This will be a nice break from all the politics and the nastiness and a way to be together." 
Thursday evening's theme was "Picnic in the Park," a nod to the Trumps' New York City roots. There was a face painting station, a carousel, sailboat racing in the South Lawn fountain, and entertainment from the United States Marine orchestra, which played a combination of showtunes and patriotic numbers.
There were snack stands set up with popcorn, cotton candy and soft pretzels, as well as a full menu of traditional picnic fare. Strings of lights were hung over green and yellow-clothed tables.

"Looking forward to this evening's Congressional "Picnic in the Park" @Whitehouse!" Melania Trump tweeted Thursday afternoon, alongside a photo of the carousel, painted horses standing at the ready. 
Picnics began after end of World War II
The tradition dates back to September 1945, when President Harry Truman hosted 150 Democratic members of Congress at Jefferson Island in the Chesapeake Bay, per the White House Historical Association. 
In 1967, President Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird, made it a bipartisan event, hosting a "Country Fair" celebration on the South Lawn for children and grandchildren of members of Congress, Cabinet members and other government officials. 
Since then, the picnic has provided a casual atmosphere for socialization and camaraderie. 
"Rosalynn Carter, looking slightly over dressed in a navy skirt, white vest and sensible shoes, said she would have worn her blue jeans, but left them in Plains. 'I left all my comfortable clothes at home,' she said with a hint of resignation," a 
Washington Post report
 from the 1977 picnic reads. 
Melania Trump kicks off 139th annual Easter Egg Roll 
The Reagans, both Bushes, Clintons and Obamas all hosted their own picnics over the years, with themes ranging from "Taste of the States" to "Hawaiian Luau."
Picnic performers have included Tammy Wynette in 1982 and the band Alabama in 1991. 
But the evening has also fostered a more relaxed environment open to some entertainment from the administration: George W. Bush press secretary Tony Snow 
played the flute
 with his band in 2007, his chief of staff Joshua Bolton 
played the bass
 in 2006, and Obama press secretary Robert Gibbs hit the 
dunk tank
 in 2009.
Thursday's picnic was Melania Trump's first major event as an official White House resident after officially moving in earlier this month with son Barron, 11.

Lewis is one of the 170 bikers arrested and charged with engaging in organized criminal activity after a brawl and shootout at a Waco, Texas, restaurant 
left nine bikers dead
. He remained in the McLennan County Jail on Wednesday with many of his biker brethren, unable to post the $1 million bail set by a judge.

The chaos in Waco began when motorcycle gangs converged on the Twin Peaks restaurant for a Sunday meeting and an uninvited gang showed up, police say. An altercation spilled from the bathroom to the bar to the patio to the parking lot as the bikers beat, stabbed and shot each other before turning their weapons on law enforcement, according to police. 
Just over a decade ago, Lewis could have been the one putting folks in cuffs. 
He was a detective and worked in the vice unit at the San Antonio Police Department for 32 years, retiring in February 2004, according to a police statement. 
"As far as my office is aware, he was a vice detective. Our vice unit primarily investigates prostitution, gambling, and liquor violations. At this point, we don't have info that he was ever assigned to infiltrate a gang," San Antonio police spokesman Sgt. Javier Salazar told CNN. 
Word that a former man in blue was among those arrested didn't sit well with Waco Police Sgt. W. Patrick Swanton.
"When I heard that this morning, it made me sick to my stomach," Swanton said.
But he said there's no doubt that the bikers who are now behind bars knew they were up to no good. 
"Honest citizens don't hide ... weapons inside a restaurant that range anywhere from assaultive type knives, to handguns, to an AK-47 and body armor. And your law-abiding citizen doesn't throw firearms into a bag of tortilla chips," he said. "A law-abiding citizen isn't going to hide a firearm or a knife in between bags of flour.  A law-abiding citizen isn't going to go into a restroom and try and stuff handguns in toilets. That happened inside Twin Peaks Sunday."
Police have not announced the gangs involved in the deadly violence, but it's been widely reported that the 
Bandidos and Cossacks
 were the principal participants in the shootout. While the U.S. Justice Department casts the Bandidos as a criminal enterprise involved in drug production and trafficking, longtime member Jimmy Graves 
told CNN that isn't the case
. 
Bandidos' history of criminal activity
02:43
"We are not a gang. We do not do gang things. We are not affiliated with gangs," he said.
Older photos on Lewis' Facebook page show him wearing the logos of Texas' Los Patrons Motorcycle Club with a few Bandidos patches, such as the acronym S.Y.L.B., short for "support your local Bandidos."
At some point in 2014, he traded in that black leather vest with the braided trim for a suede, button-up vest bearing only the trademark red-and-yellow patches of the Bandidos. 
His most recent images show him in another black vest with red trim and red-and-yellow patches, including one that says "Valerosos," the Spanish plural for brave, and another that says, "FTW," which can mean "forever two wheels" or "f*** the world."
His likes on Facebook include motorcycle outfitters and other clubs, and he boasts dozens of friends posing alongside their choppers or using Bandidos logos as their profile images. Many have blacked out their profile images in what appears to be a response to the deadly Waco shootout. 
Biker gangs: A history of violence
Lewis talks on Facebook about being a 1%er. Some say it is a reference to a decades-old American Motorcycle Association assertion that 99% of bikers were law-abiding and family-oriented, but the AMA disputes ever making the statement. Other self-proclaimed 1%ers say it simply signifies a nonconformist attitude toward society.

Mugshots: Texas biker shootout
A fight broke out among rival biker gangs in Waco, Texas, on Sunday, May 17, leaving at least nine people dead. At least 170 people were arrested, and they all face charges of engaging in organized crime. McLennan County Sheriff Parnell McNamara said that bond was being set at $1 million for each of them.

Paris (CNN)
More than 200 people were arrested and dozens were injured in Paris on Saturday after clashes erupted between police and protesters, according to a police spokesman. 
Paris demonstrations could put Macron's future in jeopardy
The spokesman told CNN at least 92 people had been injured, including 14 police officers, after protesters with the "gilets jaune" or "yellow vest" movement took to the streets to demonstrate against rising gas prices and taxes on polluting forms of transport.
Saturday's protests marked the third consecutive week of such demonstrations, although with an estimated 36,500 participants across the country they were smaller than those in weeks past, according to the French Interior Ministry. 
Last week
 about 53,000 participated, and there were about 113,000 the week before. 
French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said on Twitter Saturday that 1,500 "troublemakers" had infiltrated a group of about 200 peaceful protesters and had "come to fight" near the Champs Elysées in Paris.

Footage shared by French police showed a few demonstrators striking a police vehicle and smashing its windshield. Other videos captured 
burning cars
 and police firing tear gas to disperse protesters.
Rising fuel prices are largely attributed to a leap in the wholesale price of oil. Brent crude oil -- a benchmark for worldwide oil purchases -- increased by more than 20% in the first half of the year, from around $60 a barrel to $86.07 in early October. 
But the protests have evolved into a broader demonstration against French President Emmanuel Macron, his government and tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor. 
Macron has borne the brunt of the demonstrators' anger instead of OPEC for reducing oil production, or the US for imposing tariffs on Iran, which crippled oil exports.
A demonstrator leaves as water cannons evacuate the Place de l'Etoile on  Saturday, December 1, in Paris.
Many protesters are angry with Macron for extending the environmental policies that were first implemented by former President François Hollande.
The violent protests and vandalism in Paris have "absolutely nothing to do with the peaceful demonstrations of a legitimate unhappiness or discontent," said Macron at a news conference in Buenos Aires, where he's attending the G20 summit. 
"No cause justifies that security forces are attacked, shops pillaged, public or private buildings set on fire, pedestrians or journalists threatened or that the Arc de Triomphe is sullied," Macron said. 
Those responsible will be identified and taken to court, he added. Macron will be meeting with the French prime minister and the minister of the interior when he returns to Paris.

1. Jamal Khashoggi
Some recent revelations about the killing of a Washington Post journalist in his home country of Saudi Arabia have intensified international concern over the incident. CNN has obtained 
access to Jamal Khashoggi's WhatsApp messages
, and they show the journalist was extremely critical of Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
Khashoggi and the Saudi exile he was messaging with believed their conversations were intercepted by the Saudi government. This all comes days after a CIA assessment was made public that concluded that bin Salman had personally ordered Khashoggi's death. 
Both the Saudi government and top US officials deny there is any hard evidence linking the country's crown prince with the killing of Khashoggi in October at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul. The slaying has become a diplomatic crisis, and the Trump Administration has been hesitant to question Saudi Arabia about what really happened.

2. France
A third week of violent protests in France has led President Emmanuel Macron 
to call for a solution
. Macron has asked Prime Minister Edouard Philippe to meet with heads of political parties and representatives of the so-called "yellow vest" protesters after 92 people were injured and more than 200 arrested during a Saturday protest that attracted around 36,000 people. 
The "yellow vest" movement was formed to demonstrate against rising gas prices and taxes on polluting forms of transport. Over time, the unrest has transformed into a broader demonstration against Macron, his government, and tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor.

3. Qatar
The oil-rich country of Qatar 
is pulling out of OPEC
, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The country says it wants to focus more on natural gas production. Although Qatar's contributions to OPEC have been less than, say, Saudi Arabia, its decision to pull out of the oil cartel is significant for a few reasons. 
One, it's been a member for nearly 60 years. Two, it reflects economic tensions in the region (Qatar has been under an economic embargo by some of its neighbors, including Saudi Arabia). Three, the decision comes at a time when OPEC is looking to expand its membership, so Qatar's withdrawal definitely stings.

The Former FBI Director has been a subject of interest in an investigation by the House regarding the FBI and Justice Department's handling of probes into Hillary Clinton's email practices and Russian interference in the 2016 election. 
Comey initially pushed back on the subpoena, saying he wanted to testify in a public setting. House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte officially issued subpoenas for Comey and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch in November to bring the investigation under the wire because Goodlatte is retiring soon, and the investigation will end when the Democrats take control of the house in January.

Could the tariff tiff between the US and China be cooling? The stock markets certainly want to believe so. Stocks jumped higher Monday morning after the two countries said they would 
hold fire on further tariffs for the time being
 and try to settle differences through talks. 
During the G20 summit in Argentina, President Trump and Chinese President  Xi Jinping agreed to a temporary truce on trade. Trump agreed to maintain the 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and not raise them to 25% "at this time." In exchange, China agreed it was willing to purchase a "very substantial" amount of agriculture, energy and other goods from the United States to help reduce the trade imbalance.

Story highlights
A CNN crew joined a Coast Guard team on a day-long aerial search over the Atlantic Ocean
They were looking for the crew of the cargo ship El Faro, missing since Thursday
The vessel was sailing near the Bahamas, in waters roiled by Hurricane Joaquin
East of San Salvador Island, Bahamas, over the Atlantic Ocean  (CNN)
As the sun rose, the sweet smell of cinnamon buns wafted into the cockpit. 
Petty Officer 3rd Class Anders Forsberg, who ran communications on the HC-130, had just plucked them from the convection oven in the galley. A 63-knot tailwind at their back, most of the seven-person crew, which had just departed U.S. Coast Guard Station Clearwater in South Florida, reached for a sticky treat. 
The Coast Guard team was slated to spend at least the next nine hours in the air searching for any sign or survivor of 
the El Faro container ship
 that disappeared Thursday during Hurricane Joaquin. They knew it would be important to keep their energy up for the long, grueling task.

The search for El Faro
From left, Petty Officer 1st Class Jim Fielder, the plane's engineer, Lt. Heather Majeska, a copilot, and Petty Officer 3rd Class Anders Forsberg, who operated the plane's communications, search for debris. Despite the wealth of technology involved in the search for El Faro survivors, eyes are still one of the most important tools in the search, and everyone is expected to keep a look out.

The plane makes a sharp bank to "orbit," or fly back over, a piece of debris that the crew wants to check. On the second pass, the cockpit crew gives it another look, as will the crewmember operating the onboard camera. Here, Petty Officers 3rd Class Chris LaBelle, left, and Mark Strock sit on the edge of the cargo door in hopes of getting a better perspective on the debris.

LaBelle, the navigator, points out the plane's planned grid en route to the search area. The land mass to the left is San Salvador Island, Bahamas, and the grid requires that pilots fly in a 44-mile lane in one direction, make a U-turn almost two miles wide, and then fly back 44 miles parallel to the previous lane. The total flight was about 700 miles, roughly the distance from Minneapolis to Denver.

The HC-130 passes back over San Salvador Island, Bahamas, on its way back to the base in Clearwater, Florida. The starting point for the more than 1,000-square-mile search Monday was just northeast of San Salvador Island, in the Atlantic Ocean. The Coast Guard announced while this plane was airborne that the search for the actual container ship was over and the focus was now solely on survivors.

The plane passes over Eleuthera, another Bahamian island, located about 50 miles east of Nassau. The crew had been mildly concerned about weather before takeoff, but they called the conditions for Monday's search prime, explaining that with few clouds and no whitecaps on the smooth ocean surface, it was much easier to spot and identify debris.
 6 of 10
The plane neared the search grid just after the sun rose. The crew timed its departure from Clearwater, just before 5 a.m. ET, to maximize the sunlight. But even with optimum conditions and a wealth of debris on the water, it was difficult to see each piece -- and more importantly, determine if anyone might be clinging to it -- so the plane often made multiple passes over anything the crew deemed possibly recoverable.

Majeska, one of the copilots, snacks on a cinnamon bun while flying the plane and keeping a close watch on the water below. The task of straining your eyes to see debris floating on the water up to a mile in the distance, doubling back and taking a closer look, for a period of about 10 hours is a grueling one, so everyone on board brought plenty of food -- pizza, breakfast burritos, salads, yogurt, bologna sandwiches, sushi -- to keep their energy up for the long mission.

When the HC-130 first took off, the cockpit was dark, the instruments on the control panel offering the only light. Here, the first rays of sun gleam into the cockpit as Lt. Janelle Setta, a copilot, left, and Fielder, the engineer, guide the plane to the search area.

The Lockheed HC-130 that took the CNN crew up is a modified version of the C-130 Hercules transport plane. This model is suited specifically for search-and-rescue missions, whether they be in combat or otherwise. Though Monday's search kept the plane in the air for 10 hours, it landed with more than 15,000 pounds of fuel. A Coast Guard pilot told CNN that in the event of an emergency or change of plans, the plane could have remained in the air several more hours.

Once they reached their starting point, off the coast of the far-flung Bahamian island of San Salvador, they promptly dropped to an altitude of 500 feet, a height from which the pilots and crew could see objects in the water with the naked eye.

Sure, there's plenty of technology aboard the massive cargo plane -- including radar and a sophisticated underbelly camera the crew asked CNN not to film because it's used in the Coast Guard's drug interdiction efforts -- but the most vital equipment on this aircraft may have been the seven
pairs of eyes.
Well, nine. 
Journalists typically want to be flies on the wall, not engaging with a story so much as observing it, but in a search-and-rescue mission where 33 people could be clinging to life after days adrift in the Joaquin-whipped Atlantic Ocean, everyone needed to chip in. 
"Just because it's your first time doesn't mean you can't help," Lt. Janelle Setta, the HC-130's copilot, told one of the two CNN journalists on board.

Lt. Heather Majeska, the other copilot, added that it would be easier to survey the water if you mentally cut the horizon in half. The grid that the HC-130 crew was searching required the pilots to fly a straight 44-mile course, make a U-turn onto a parallel track and fly 44 miles the other way, repeating the process over and over. The "lanes" of the grid were only about 2 miles apart, so there was no need to strain your eyes peering into the distance. 
Company: El Faro skipper had plan to deal with storm
If anyone spotted someone in the water, the pilots would fly over them and the crew would drop a survival kit with food and fresh water along with a lifeboat, if they needed it, while contacting the nearest Coast Guard cutter, helicopter or commercial ship to pick them up, Setta explained. 
'Let's find 'em!'
The plane rumbled down to searching altitude, appearing much lower than 50 stories above the water. Petty Officers 3rd Class Tyler Mize and Mark Strock strapped themselves in with thick nylon webbing, and after a series of safety checks, stood by as the cargo door -- big enough to drive a Humvee through -- opened.
'Pray for the crew:' Relatives await definitive news of El Faro's missing 
They tossed a buoy out of the back of the plane as it cruised at roughly 150 knots (173 mph). The buoy contained a beacon that allows the Coast Guard to gauge currents and ocean conditions (though two crew members confided that predicting ocean currents after a Category 4 hurricane is an inexact science at best).

 search. At 500 feet, they opened cargo hatch so 2 Coast Guardsmen could get a better view.

Still, Majeska and the crew were hopeful.
"Let's find 'em!" she said as she and Setta began flying the plane along the grid. 
Quickly, crew members began commenting on the abundance of debris located near an oil sheen that could be seen for miles. 
"I'm picking up so many targets," Petty Officer 3rd Class Chris LaBelle, the plane's navigator, said through the headphones. "It's crazy how much debris there is."
"Yeah, it is. I've never seen this much debris before," another crew member replied, commenting that it appears a ship exploded rather than sunk.
There were Styrofoam chunks, a 2X4, what appeared to be a red scarf, a ladder and large pieces of corrugated siding that could be from shipping containers. But the bulk of the debris resembled bloated chunks of white bread that had been in a duck pond for too long. 
Anything orange or yellow, even it was just the sun playing tricks, excited the crew. The team doubled back to "orbit," or fly over, a white-and-orange tube floating on the water. It turned out to be nothing. 
A half hour later, a white-and-yellow object drew the team's attention. It was tough to see, even on the second pass. Was it ... splashing? 
Mize popped wintergreen Life Savers, perhaps not realizing the coincidence, as he zoomed the underbelly camera in on the item, which resembled a large water heater. It couldn't be determined what was causing the splashing, so the team sent coordinates to a nearby Coast Guard cutter to have a closer look.
"It's usually not this busy," Setta said. "It's usually a lot of droning along looking at nothing."
Debris a good sign
The wealth of debris is good news, as the Coast Guard team sees it. If the debris is from the El Faro, it means that its crew had plenty to cling to or float on when they fell overboard.  
"Honestly, I think there's a good chance people could be out there with all this debris," Petty Officer 1st Class Jim Fielder, the plane's engineer, said.
The HC-130 crew wouldn't hear the news until they landed, but while they were airborne, Coast Guard Capt. Mark Fedor held a news conference in which he told reporters that the search for the El Faro was off. 
The focus now was solely on survivors, which you could tell the team suspected. After all, it's tough for a 738-foot cargo ship to disappear without sinking. 
Search teams found one survival suit containing remains, Fedor said at his news conference, but they were unidentifiable, so it's not clear if they belonged to one of the 28 Americans or five Polish nationals on board the El Faro. 
The suits, which the Coast Guard crew calls "Gumby suits," are another factor bolstering the team's hopes. A cargo ship like the El Faro would've been equipped with Gumby suits and lifeboats. The El Faro's crew would've had the time and training to use both, given that, before it vanished, it called in a distress signal to say the ship had lost propulsion and was taking water. 
Even at 500 feet with perfect water conditions, it's tough to tell if something is helpful or just debris. 
pic.twitter.com/7g43xLGKX1
A capsized orange-bottomed boat buoyed hopes again, but the crew grew skeptical upon realizing it had a V-shaped hull and was likely too large to be a lifeboat. 
Asked one of the crew: Did searchers ever recover the boat in which two Florida 14-year-olds went missing? Most of the HC-130 crew members took part in that search over the summer as well. 
Indeed, it was recovered, came the answer. The team decided to move on after Mize and the camera determined no one was clinging to the capsized boat. 
Shortly afterward, the plane flew over another corrugated panel. Then what appeared to be a life vest. Another false call. Then a second boat -- this time an old-school tri-hull, probably from the 1970s or 1980s. It, too, was determined not to be flotsam from the El Faro.
1,056 square miles
There was a lot of double- and triple-checking on this search mission because, the crew explained, there was so much debris and they wanted to be absolutely certain it was unimportant before they moved on. Can you imagine, Setta asked, if you were down there and saw the HC-130 fly over, but the crew didn't see you? 
The debris seemed to thin out over the last hour of the search, though a few pieces caught the team's eye: a large box, "something purple," a piece of wood paneling and a bed liner for a pickup truck. That last piece was initially thought promising, as the El Faro's cargo included automobiles. 
Our path on 
 search. See the circles? That's where we doubled back for closer looks. 
pic.twitter.com/Sk5QrYSqP8
After almost eight hours in the air completing the 1,056-square-mile grid (a total flight of 700 miles, the distance from Minneapolis to Denver), it was time to head back to Clearwater, about two hours away. The plane had taken off with 64,000 pounds of fuel and, for safety reasons, needed to return with 15,000 pounds. 
The crewmembers were familiar and friendly throughout the flight, as people who regularly spend hours with each other in tight quarters might be, but their jocularity grew as the HC-130 soared back into the clouds for the journey home. 
No, they didn't find any survivors, but they did critical work clearing a huge swath of ocean so the Coast Guard can focus its resources on new, unsearched grids. Much of a search-and-rescue crew's job is ruling out territory, saying, Nope, they're not here.  
That's especially important considering Joaquin's ferocity and the massive debris field searchers believe the El Faro left behind, Setta explained. 
"If (the survivors) were on a life raft in 140-mph winds," she said, "they could get blown pretty far."

 (CNN)
Close to two-thirds of France's fixed speed cameras have been vandalized by yellow-vest protesters since November, as demonstrators revolt against lowered speed limits introduced by the government last year. 
A spokesman for the French Ministry of the Interior told CNN that 60% of fixed speed cameras have been damaged by gilets jaunes demonstrators since November 17, when the protests erupted. 
"I saw on social networks a few fools who appear next to burnt speed cameras. I do not wish for them to one day face the reality of a death on the road. It's not about figures, it's about life," Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told reporters Thursday. 
Emmanuel Barbe, the head of France's road safety agency, also warned that vandalism of the country's speed cameras will likely lead to more deaths. "This damage to the speed camera network... will lead to deaths. And that makes me profoundly sad," he told France Inter. 
Many protesters are angry at the French government's decision in 2018 to reduce the speed limit on two-lane highways to 80 km/h.
According to the French site 
radars-auto.com
, the proportion of cameras damaged by protesters could be as high as 65%.

French news agency Europe 1 estimated in December that around half of all speed cameras in France had been put out of service for either a short or long period of time, while close to 300 devices had been completely destroyed -- in most cases after being burnt. Other devices have been spray-painted or covered in film. 
In some departments including the Vaucluse in southeast France, upward of 90% of speed cameras were put out of service following protests in November and December. 
The French government's road safety association, Sécurité routière, previously refused to release official statistics on the precise number of speed cameras that had been affected during the protests. The organization has not responded to a CNN request for comment. 
This spike in vandalism is seen as a response to the French government's controversial decision in July 2018 to lower speed limits to 80 kilometers per hour (50 miles per hour) from 90 kilometers per hour (56 miles per hour) on two-lane highways in a bid to reduce a sharp rise in road deaths. 
The change affects 40% of France's road network, and around 250,000 miles of roads. The French government indicated that the measure could help avoid between 350 and 400 road deaths a year. 
"Unsafe roads are not inevitable," Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said in 2018. "Lowering speed reduces the number of accidents, as well as the severity of these accidents." 
He also told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper: "There are 3,500 deaths and 70,000 injured each year -- 70,000! After decades of progress, the toll is getting worse." 
French police investigate reports of decorated officer filmed punching protesters
Many people around the country have nevertheless revolted against the speed limit reduction, and it formed a key trigger for the roundabout blockades that brought France's road network to a halt at the height of the yellow-vest protests. 
"The outcry is strong because it is such a tangible issue for ordinary people," Jérôme Fourquet from the Ifop polling agency told the BBC. "Around 70% of the population is opposed, and there is no sign of that abating." 
The ensuing damage to France's speed cameras is costing road agencies and local councils millions of euros. The cost of repairing speed cameras ranges from 500 euros ($574) for minor damage, up to between 60,000 euros ($69,000) and 80,000 euros for the cost of totally replacing a device, according to the French business magazine Capital. 
France also faces the loss of billions of euros worth of revenue derived from speeding fines.
Protesters found guilty of vandalizing or destroying speed cameras face fines of up to 75,000 euros and prison sentences of up to five years.

Paris (CNN)
French authorities appealed for calm on Saturday as spurts of unrest erupted across France in the latest gilets jaunes, or "yellow vest," protests.
About 50,000 people demonstrated, according to Interior Minister Christophe Castaner. Large gatherings were held in Paris, Bordeaux and Marseilles.
In Paris, 3,500 people participated in protests on Saturday, much higher than the 800 who took to the streets last week, police said. At least 34 people were taken in for questioning in the capital city.
Benjamin Griveaux, government spokesman, confirmed that he and his team had to evacuate his office in Paris after demonstrators broke into his courtyard by knocking down the door with construction machinery.

Violence was reported in Montpellier and Troyes, where demonstrators tried to enter prefectures, and in Avignon, where some attempted to break into the Court of Justice. Violence was also reported in Beauvais, authorities said.

The protests are named after the yellow high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their vehicles.
They have morphed from dissent over rising gas prices and eco-taxes into a broader demonstration against President Emmanuel Macron and his government, and tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor.
France's Emmanuel Macron calls for respect and unity in New Year's speech
"I call on everybody to be responsible and respect the rule of law," Castaner said on Twitter.
Castaner said he gathered local police officials for a video conference "as tensions and violence have been witnessed in Paris and in a few other cities."
Last weekend, an estimated 32,000 protesters took to the streets. There have been some protests since the year began but mostly they have been modest demonstrations on roads and roundabouts.
Saturday's protests are the first big gatherings of the year.

He acknowledged anger against injustice but said hateful speech would not be tolerated. Macron said France "wants to build a better future" while imploring people to respect each other.
In December, Macron pledged to increase the minimum wage and get rid of new pension taxes, a move that didn't appease the anger of some of the protesters.
Ten people have died in connection with the protests, with most deaths taking place in traffic accidents related to blockades in November and December.

Paris (CNN)
French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a crackdown on the "scourge" of anti-Semitism, days after 
protesters held rallies against a rise 
in anti-Semitic incidents across the country.
Speaking to leaders of the Jewish community in Paris on Wednesday evening, Macron criticized a "resurgence of anti-Semitism unseen since World War II," which he said is not only happening in France but in "all of Europe and most Western democracies."
The president added that "anti-Zionism is one of the modern forms of anti-Semitism," and in response, France will adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's 
definition of anti-Semitism
. 
French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner is also taking measures to ban three anti-Semitic and far-right groups which the president said "fueled hatred."

This comes amid a recent rise in anti-Semitic incidents. France, which is home to Europe's largest Jewish community, saw a 74% increase in such acts in 2018, of 541 incidents compared to 311 the year before, according to authorities. 
On Saturday, 
several gilets jaunes (or "yellow vest") protesters
 were filmed hurling abuse at philosopher and vocal Israel supporter Alain Finkielkraut as he ran into protesters during the 14th consecutive weekend of marches.
Insults including "dirty Zionist," "f***ing Islamophobe" and "f*** your mother" were hurled at Finkelkraut, while less hostile activists walked him away from the demonstration and behind police lines.

Tuesday's marches against anti-Semitism
 came after around 80 graves were desecrated with swastikas overnight in a Jewish cemetery in eastern France, according to local officials. Photos showed tombstones spray-painted with blue and yellow Nazi symbols and other graffiti.
Macron condemned the attack during his visit Tuesday to the cemetery in Quatzenheim, where he inspected the damage.
"We will take actions, we will use laws and we will punish," Macron told local communities leaders at the cemetery.
"Those who did this are not worthy of the republic ... France will punish them. I don't want what happened here to give ideas to others."

Officer Terrence Carraway rushed to respond when a gunman opened fire from a home in Florence County, South Carolina. As the barrage of bullets kept coming, he and his colleagues had to be rescued.
Carraway was among seven law enforcement officers shot Wednesday evening during a two-hour standoff that began when deputies attempted to execute a search warrant.
On cell phone video recorded near the shooting, scores of gunshots can be heard. For about 15 seconds, the firing appears to be constant and intense.
Officer Terrence Carraway was killed Wednesday.
The witness who took the video saw two officers get shot in front of a driveway at a home an estimated 300 yards away from where the alleged gunman was barricaded, the witness told CNN on Thursday. 
Carraway, a 30-year veteran of the Florence Police Department, was minutes away when he got the call to help fellow officers. He died on his way to the hospital, city of Florence spokesman John Wukela said.

 reported. 
One city police officer still was hospitalized in serious condition Thursday afternoon, and two others had been treated and released, city officials said. The conditions of the three sheriff's deputies who were wounded were not immediately known. 
An eighth person, a 20-year-old man inside the house, was shot during the standoff, Florence County Sheriff's Office Chief Deputy Glenn Kirby told 
WBTW.
 His condition is also unknown.
Suspect is disbarred attorney
The man suspected of shooting the officers was arrested Wednesday evening, officials said. The suspect is Fred Hopkins, 74, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on condition of anonymity.
The suspect surrendered after talking to a negotiator and was taken to the hospital for treatment, Kirby told 
The suspect has not been formally charged, Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott, whose office is leading the investigation, said Thursday. 
Online property records list Hopkins as one of the owners of the house where the shootings happened.
Hopkins was disbarred as an attorney in 1984, four years after he got his law license, online records show. He was ordered to pay $18,000 to a court in Lexington County, an amount said to be equal to the sum of "wrongfully collected" attorney fees. 
Hopkins was charged in 2014 with disorderly conduct, online court records show. It is his only known prior arrest.
Hopkins and his wife have nine adopted children, a woman who said she was a longtime friend of the Hopkins family told 
The State newspaper. 
"I loved those kids like they were our own," Judy Gibson told the Columbia, South Carolina, newspaper. "Why this tragedy happened? I cannot answer that. I am still in shock."
The suspect had been married previously and had two sons before moving to Florence, the newspaper reported.
It's unclear whether authorities have determined why he opened fire.
 
CNN affiliate 
WMBF
 reported, citing Kirby, that deputies were executing a search warrant linked to allegations of sexual assault of a minor who lives in the home but that the gunman was not a suspect in that case.
However, Kirby on Friday denied to CNN that he had given the reason for the search warrant.
CNN has not independently confirmed why the search warrant had been issued or what it alleged.
Authorities direct traffic Wednesday near the shooting scene in Florence, South Carolina.
An armored vehicle had to shield officers
The gunman initially shot at the Florence County deputies and kept shooting when more law enforcement officers arrived, officials said.
"These officers went there unknowing the firepower this suspect had," Florence County Sheriff Kenney Boone said. 
The seven officers who were wounded could not get away, he said. 
"He had an advantage, and the officers couldn't get to the ones that were down," Boone said.
As the suspect barricaded himself in the home with children, authorities used a mine-resistant ambush protected, or MRAP, vehicle -- something usually associated with war zones -- to get all the wounded officers to safety, Boone said.
Blood-soaked evidence lies in the Florence neighborhood where law enforcement officers were shot.
Video footage after the shooting shows a bloody police vest and blood spatter on the ground as yellow tape goes up around the scene. 
'He was the proverbial gentle giant'
City officials lauded Carraway on Thursday as man who had a steady temperament and a deep commitment to the community.
Carraway had started a mentoring program for disadvantaged youths called
 Camp FEVER
, said Heidler, the police chief.
"He had a passion for kids, ...  to see kids in impoverished areas have the opportunity to do the things they might not have the opportunity" to do, Heidler said. "He was a giant of a man, but he was the proverbial gentle giant, and I loved him."
Florence Mayor Stephen Wukela said Carraway had "the ability to bring the sense of order and peacefulness to the most difficult of situations."
"That made him a great cop. That made him a great person," the mayor said.
At a vigil Thursday evening at the First Baptist Church of Florence, Carraway's pastor said he wore two badges.
"He had another badge. It was a badge of love," Rev. Cecil Bromell told the packed church. "He demonstrated love in the purest form."
A public viewing will be held from 9 to 11 a.m. Monday at the Florence Center, and a memorial will follow at noon, he said.
'Selfless acts of bravery'
President Donald Trump and South Carolina lawmakers also offered prayers for the victims. 
"My thoughts and prayers are with the Florence County Sheriff's Office and the Florence Police Department tonight, in South Carolina. We are forever grateful for what our Law Enforcement Officers do 24/7/365," Trump tweeted Wednesday night.

Paris (CNN)
A 10th person has died in connection with the "gilets jaunes" or "yellow vest" protests in France as they enter their sixth consecutive weekend.
A 36-year-old man was killed in a road accident in the southern French city of Perpignan after encountering a blockade set up by "yellow vest" protesters late Friday night, according to a city spokeswoman.
"At a roundabout blocked by the gilets jaunes, a man in his car hit a truck in front of him. The driver of the car died," the spokeswoman said.
Most of the deaths occurred in traffic accidents related to blockades in November and December, according to Le Parisien newspaper and CNN reporting. Earlier this month, an 80-year-old woman died when a tear gas canister went through her window.
The protests -- named after the yellow high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their vehicles -- started November 17 in reaction to an eco-tax on gas but have since morphed into disparate demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron.

Paris (CNN)
Emmanuel Macron swept to the French presidency in 2017, seemingly out of nowhere and with large grassroots support. The irony may not be lost on the 40-year-old former banker that his new political foe, the "gilets jaunes" (or "yellow vest") movement, came to prominence in a similar way -- without the help or influence of France's usual institutions of power, the unions, the associations or the traditional political parties.     
On Monday night, Macron pledged to increase France's minimum wage and scrap new pension taxes in response to weeks of violent protests that have challenged his leadership. Yet what is very clear, the morning after the President tried to find the way to the hearts of his countrymen (as his spokesman had it), is that there is now a complete distrust of his methods.   
Yellow vest protesters watch Macron's address to the nation on Monday night. 
Out on the barricades and in the TV studios there was an exhausting and meticulous debate over every detail of the President's concessions. Where was the devil lurking in those details? What trick was the government pulling here? One heard most often: Where is my piece of the pie?   
At their core, the French are staunch individualists who pull together in noisy and dramatic demonstrations when they can find common grievance. Fuel taxes, buying power, fiscal justice: that's what the gilets jaunes protesters say their movement is about. But when you come right down to it, people join the demonstrations because it is personal. How am I affected by government action?  
Macron promises minimum wage hike in response to violent protests in France
Some gilets jaunes argue that the speed limit on rural roads should not be reduced to 80 kilometers an hour, as the government has suggested. Others are vandalizing automatic radars meant to enforce the speed limits. Everybody seems to want something, including some things the government really cannot fully provide. Last night one demonstrator was heard to demand more government protection. He couldn't provide any specifics. Just more protection, one presumes, from life's woes.

The future question for Macron is whether he can get the yellow-vested genie back into the bottle soon, or even during the rest of the three-and-a-half years he has left in office. Could it be that the current grassroots movement has permanently wounded his own grassroots movement? Macron's climbdown from his economic ambitions may be matched with an even more damaging political descent.
For the past year, as Theresa May Brexited and Angela Merkel exited, Macron appeared to be an emerging European power.
Just a month ago, at November's WWI commemorations, Macron was lecturing 70 world leaders -- including an irritated Donald Trump -- on how to build a more just world. Now he faces accusations from French streets that his government is one of the unjust ones. 
For the past year, as Theresa May Brexited and Angela Merkel exited, Macron appeared to be an emerging European power. Remember those Macron magazine covers from last year? Among others, The Economist had "Europe's saviour," while Time went for "The Next Leader of Europe." Today they all look sadly out of date. Macron has been badly diminished by his first crisis; both at home and abroad.
Macron will need to do a lot more to silence the protesters
How -- and if -- he can bounce back is yet to be seen. The French presidency is just as all-consuming as it is all-powerful. If you run out of ideas the way Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy did, or run out of energy, the way François Mitterrand and François Hollande did, it is immediately apparent. The French street senses right away when a president falters or retreats, especially one who was perceived from the beginning as the smartest kid in the class.
Add to that the pessimism that seems to be part of this country's DNA and you see the challenge that lies ahead for Macron. He was anointed as France's last great hope for reform. That hope has now faded but not been entirely extinguished. If it can be revived depends on how quickly the smart kid learns from his first political comeuppance.

Paris (CNN)
France will suspend fuel price hikes after ongoing protests turned violent over the weekend, in a major concession by President Emmanuel Macron's government. 
According to CNN affiliate BFMTV, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe will announce a moratorium Tuesday on fuel price hikes, which had been scheduled to come into effect on January 1.
The rising cost of gasoline and diesel fuel sparked protests that have since evolved into broader demonstrations against Macron's government, exposing tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor. 
The protesters, known as the "gilets jaunes," take their name from the high-visibility yellow vests that drivers are required to keep in their vehicles for safety reasons.

Philippe canceled a trip to the COP24 climate conference in Poland to address the issue, which had threatened to flare again this coming weekend.

Around 400 people were arrested after a violent minority turned on police, throwing projectiles and vandalizing statues.

Students have also joined the "yellow vests" movement and, according to Reuters, demonstrators set buildings on fire and there were violent clashes with police on Tuesday.

Access to schools in Creteil and Versailles was also blocked, Reuters said.
The news agency also reported that there were clashes in Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux and Orleans.
Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz said that among the protesters were people from across the country who had descended upon Paris with the express intent of causing trouble. 
He added that authorities would crack down hardest on those who had joined the street demonstrations explicitly to carry out violent acts.
"There are varied profiles but there are definitely profiles of people who have come from the provinces all over France, obviously to carry out acts of violence, and it is to these people that the criminal response I will say will be the strongest."
How the 'Yellow Vests' formed
The cost of diesel has surged 16% this year from an average €1.24 ($1.41) per liter to €1.48 ($1.69), even hitting €1.53 ($1.74) in October, according to UFIP, France's oil industry federation.
Protesters reacted by taking to the streets of Paris, setting fire to tires -- even cars, in some instances -- for two weekends in a row. Violence has left at least two people dead and more than 600 people injured. Protesters struck some of the wealthiest parts of the French capital, looting luxury shops and smashing bank windows. Police have arrested hundreds.
The "gilets jaunes" may have begun with motorists protesting the tax rise, but it has since mushroomed into a movement against the reformist policies of Macron, thrusting the most severe political crisis on the 40-year-old leader since he took office 19 months ago.

The "gilets jaunes" is a grassroots movement that emerged online with Facebook events set up by regular citizens to coordinate road blockades across France. 
The movement has no ties to the big French trade unions that usually organize large-scale protests in the country, nor does it have formal spokespeople. Some protesters say that Cauchy and Moreau, who have spoken on behalf of the group, are not their legitimate leaders. 
The group mirrors Macron's own rise to power, which began with the creation of his own grassroots movement, "En Marche!" ("On the move!"), and no backing by the big established parties. Macron said he was neither from the left nor right, just that he was "for France" and branded himself as a man of the people. Macron campaigned on promises to radically change France and his ideas were published in a book he wrote called "Revolution."
But the wave of support that brought Macron to power has waned, 
with the young leader's approval rating dropping to 25% in November
. And public support for the movement is high -- a Harris poll conducted after Saturday's protest suggests that
 almost three-quarters of French people support it. 
Macron is just the latest of many French leaders who have lost support for trying to transform France into a friendlier nation for doing business. His slashing of the wealth tax, for example, was unpopular and triggered criticism that he works for the elite and condescends to the poor.
One of the thousands of protesters who took to the streets to call for lower fuel prices
Many at the protests in Paris came in from rural areas and say they are struggling to make ends meet. Maxime Nicolle, 31, who was at a protest Saturday, is from a rural part of Brittany, and has been a member of the "gilets jaunes" since its creation in November. 
He said his family of three struggles to survive on €1,500 a month. "It's really about inequality and how the wealth is distributed. It's a battle between the financial system and the population," he told CNN. 
Hugo Melchior, from a wealthy neighborhood in Rennes, northwest France, doesn't even own a car, yet he supports the movement.
"We are dealing with a convergence of anger, frustration, exasperation and weariness that's been suppressed for too long. And they now have this immense power, they find themselves able to act together at a local level against a common enemy -- the state power personified by President Emmanuel Macron, who incites hatred because of his endless arrogance."

A man attempts to rob a gas station in Winter Garden, Florida
When the store clerks can't open the safe, he fires a gun at one of them
The bullet hits the clerk's cell phone, which is in his chest pocket
He complains of chest pains and goes to a hospital but is quickly released
A gas station clerk's smartphone may have saved his life Monday by blocking a bullet fired at his chest in an attempted armed robbery.
The shooting happened after a man entered the store at the Hess gas station in Winter Garden, Florida, early Friday and asked a clerk to help him find a particular beverage.
The man then pulled out a revolver and demanded that the clerk open the safe, 
CNN affiliate WESH reported
, but the clerk was unable to get the safe door open. 
Another clerk then entered the store and was also ordered to open the safe.
After both the store workers' efforts to open it failed, the man fired a single gunshot as he left the store, WESH reported, citing police.
Emergency services workers were called to the store, and as they were interviewing one of the clerks, he complained of chest pains.
"So they started looking at the clerk. That's when they realized that the guy had actually shot at him, hit him, struck his cell phone, and the cell phone had stopped his bullet," Winter Garden Police Lt. Scott Allen said.
The chest pains were caused by the impact of the bullet on the cell phone, which was in the clerk's chest pocket, according to WESH. 
He didn't suffer any other injuries and was quickly released after being checked at a hospital, the TV station said.
His HTC smartphone came off worse. A photo showed its screen shattered around a hole where the bullet had lodged.
"I've seen individuals get shot with low-caliber handguns and I've seen it be life ending. So, for this gentleman to be as lucky as he is, it's a good day for us," Allen said.
The other clerk was reported to be unharmed.
Police described the suspect in the attack as a black man about 6 feet tall wearing a dark-colored hooded sweatshirt, pants, sunglasses, a bright yellow traffic vest and white gloves, according to WESH. He remained on the loose Monday evening, it reported.
Authorities aren't disclosing the name of the clerk who was shot, the TV station reported.

George Zimmerman, charged in the shooting death of a 17-year-old Florida boy, is suing NBC Universal for using "the oldest form of yellow journalism" by editing an audio tape of his 911 call to make him sound racist, the lawsuit says.
Zimmerman is seeking "damages in excess of the jurisdictional limit" in Seminole County Circuit Court in Florida, where the lawsuit was filed Thursday.
Zimmerman, who is Hispanic and is 
charged with second-degree murder
, is accused of fatally shooting 
Trayvon Martin
, who was African-American. The February incident has provoked national controversy.
Zimmerman says he shot Martin in self-defense. Attorneys for Martin's family say the teen was shot and killed "in cold blood."

"NBC saw the death of Trayvon Martin not as a tragedy but as an opportunity to increase ratings, and so set about to create the myth that George Zimmerman was a racist and predatory villain," the lawsuit says.

"Because of NBC's deceptive and exploitative manipulations, the public wrongly believes that Zimmerman 'use(d) a racial epithet' while describing Martin during the call to the dispatcher on that fateful night," the suit says.
NBC Universal disputed the accusations Friday.
"There was no intent to portray Mr. Zimmerman unfairly," the company said in a prepared statement. "We intend to vigorously defend our position in court."
The defamation lawsuit accuses the network of sensationalizing and manipulating a potential "racial powder keg that would result in months, if not years, of topics for their failing news program, particularly the plummeting ratings for their ailing Today Show."
The edited recordings included multiple deletions, removed intervening dialogue between Zimmerman and the dispatcher, and juxtaposed unrelated content "to make it appear that Zimmerman was a racist, and that he was racially profiling Trayvon Martin," the lawsuit says.
NBC aired various edited versions of the 911 call on March 19, 20, 22 and 27, the suit says.
The suit accuses the network of malice, highlighting correspondent Ron Allen's segment on "The Today Show" on March 27.
Timeline of events in case
"Allen's broadcast removed a critical aspect of the dialogue between Zimmerman and the dispatcher, bringing the 'up to no good' and 'he looks black' statements even closer together, to further the false and defamatory implication that Zimmerman had said he believed Martin was 'up to no good' because 'he looks black,'" the suit says.
The lawsuit accuses NBC of falsely claiming that Zimmerman said "f------ coons" on the February 26 call.
"The truth, as known to the defendants, was that Zimmerman said 'f------ punks' and there was no evidence, or reason to believe, that Zimmerman uttered a racial epithet during the call," the suit says.
Zimmerman mentioned Martin's race only when prompted by the dispatcher, the suit says.
NBC never aired an "earnest" retraction and never apologized to Zimmerman, who has since experienced death threats, a bounty on his head and a genuine fear for his life, the suit says. He now lives in hiding, court documents say.
NBC News President Steve Capus "made a bogus non-apology that claimed the doctoring was merely a 'mistake,'" the suit says.
Because of the death threats, Zimmerman wears a bulletproof vest and was even dismissed from his college because it felt fellow students could be endangered, the lawsuit says. At the time of the incident with Martin, Zimmerman was living in a community known as The Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford, Florida, court papers say.
"Due to the defendants' journalistic crimes, Zimmerman has been transformed into one of the most hated men in America," the suit says.
Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, told "In Session's" Jean Casarez that NBC tried "to get ahead of the curve coverage thinking that they had themselves a person who was a racist, and they were wrong."
The suit also names as defendants Lilia Rodriguez Luciano of Dade County, Florida, who was reporting directly from Sanford. Her employment was terminated by NBC as a result of her reporting, the suit says.
Also named as a defendant is Jeffrey Burnside of Dade County, another journalist who was reporting from Sanford to his station, NBC-owned WTVJ in Miami, the suit says. Burnside was also fired by NBC, the suit said.

Paris, France  (CNN)
French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that the minimum wage will be raised and that new taxes on pensions would be scrapped as he responded to 
weeks of violent protests
 which have challenged his leadership.
In a televised address to the nation, Macron said the violent protests -- which have morphed from a grassroots movement against fuel tax hikes to disparate demonstrations against his presidency -- have been "unacceptable" and "will not be in any way indulged."
But he proposed several social reforms, including an increase in the minimum wage by 100 euros ($113) a month beginning in January 2019 that will not  cost employers extra and a promise that overtime hours will not be taxed. Macon also remained defiant and said he would not reinstate the wealth tax but will fight tax fraud.
The reforms are expected to cost the government between $8.1 billion and $10.1 billion, Oliver Dussopt, France's secretary of state to the Ministry of Public Action and Accounts, told French television station BFM.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, President Emmanuel Macron and Ecology Minister François de Rugy meet with trade union leaders on Monday.
While Macron conceded that much of the anger that protesters feel is "just" and that people had "legit concerns," he condemned the violence which arose during the protests -- including cars being set afire and property vandalized.

"No anger justifies attacking a policeman or pillaging a public place or shop," he said. "When violence breaks out, freedom is lost."
Macron added that the discontent comes from "40 years of malaise" but acknowledged his government has not been able to respond to it properly in the 18 months it had been in power. He said he assumed his responsibility for that. 
Who are the 'yellow vest' protesters causing chaos in France?
"We are at a historical changing point in the history of our country," Macron added. "Through dialogue, respect, commitment we will succeed ... My concern is only you, our only battle is for France."
On Monday morning, as Macron met trade unions and business leaders ahead of tonight's much-anticipated national address, French students took further action.
There were disruptions in up to 120 schools across the country -- including 40 schools completely blockaded by students -- a spokeswoman for the Education Ministry said.
The students were demonstrating against the government's recent education reforms, including changes to university admissions, which they say will be more selective. 
Macron is expected to call for national unity this evening in the wake of "
gilets jaunes
" -- or "yellow vests" -- protests that saw 1,709 people held in custody following the most recent weekend of demonstrations. 
Protests numbers fall, political cost rises
This
 weekend's protests 
were smaller than in previous weeks. But they also saw more people taken into custody than in all three previous weekends combined, according to the Interior Ministry.
Overall, the weekend's protests, which stretched as far and wide as the southern cities of Marseille and Toulouse, brought out 136,000 people across the country, the ministry added.
The protests paralyzed Paris, with landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower closed to the public and some metro stations shut. Sporting events across the country were called off.
Protesters gather in the Place de la République on December 8.
In response, around 8,000 police were put on the streets of Paris and tens of thousands more deployed across the country. Officers fired rubber bullets and hundreds of canisters of tear gas at the demonstrators, some of whom 
set vehicles on fire.
A 'catastrophe' for French economy 
The French retail sector has suffered a loss in revenue of about $1.1 billion since the beginning of the yellow vest protests last month, according to Sophie Amoros, a spokeswoman for the French retail federation.
On Sunday, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire went as far as to say the unrest was creating a "catastrophe" for the French economy.
Demonstrators turn out in Marseille on Monday to protest against unsafe and unsanitary housing.
The protests, named after the yellow high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their vehicles, began as a small movement in rural France against a new eco-tax on fuel that demonstrators felt would push their budgets over the edge.
In response, Macron was forced to suspend the tax hike, which had been due to come into effect on January 1. 
Despite Macron's concession, the movement has since expanded into a protest of many colors -- from people demonstrating against unsafe housing conditions, to students unhappy with education reforms, and anti-immigration campaigners.

Police fired water cannon and tear gas at "gilets jaunes" or yellow vest protesters in central Paris, who have marched through the city for the ninth consecutive weekend.
A total of 59 people were questioned by authorities, on charges including unlawful weapons and participating in a group with the goal of committing violent crimes.
Violent clashes occurred on the Champs-Elysées, a epicenter of 
the protests which have brought repeated disruption to the city
.
'Yellow vest' protests across France trigger spurts of violence, calls for calm
The total number of demonstrators has also risen from last weekend, the country's Interior Ministry said.
More than 32,000 people were taking part across France at 2 p.m. local time (8 a.m. ET) on Saturday, a rise of 6,000 compared to the same time seven days ago.

In Paris itself, 8,000 were marching, a fourfold increase on last weekend. 
The protests began as a campaign against a gas tax hike, but have morphed into a broader rally against President Emmanuel Macron's government.
They caused many
 tourist sites and landmarks to be closed
 in anticipation of violent scenes.
Gilets jaunes protesters march through Paris on Saturday.
Some of the demonstrations in the capital on Saturday took place near the Rue de Trevise in the city's 9th arrondissement, where hours earlier 
an explosion at a bakery killed two firefighters and a Spanish citizen.
In his New Year's address, Macron referred to the movement without naming it specifically.
He acknowledged anger against injustice but said hateful speech would not be tolerated, and called on people to respect each other.
Last month, he pledged to increase the minimum wage and scrap new pension taxes, in an effort to appease the protesters.
At least 10 deaths have been linked to the protests, with most taking place in traffic accidents related to blockades in November and December.

Paris (CNN)
A former security aide to French President Emmanuel Macron has been placed in custody as part of an investigation into his use of diplomatic passports, the Paris prosecutor's office told CNN on Thursday.
Alexandre Benalla was fired from Macron's office in July last year after 
being filmed beating up
 a May Day protester.
He is currently under investigation for the "illegal use of a document certifying a professional position" and "forgery and use of forgery," the prosecutor's office said.
Macron's chief of staff, Patrick Strzoda, on Wednesday testified at a Senate hearing that Benalla had used his diplomatic passports about 20 times between August 1 and December 31, 2018. 
Strzoda also said Benalla had used a fake document with the letterhead of the President's chief of staff to request his second service passport.

Benalla used the passports on business trips to Africa, including to Chad, senators heard. 
Speaking to Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper in recent weeks, Benalla said he had gained no improper benefit from the use of the passports.
"I may have been wrong to use these passports," Benalla said in a December 30 interview. "But I did it only for personal comfort, to make it easier for me to travel in airports. I did not use them for my business, and I do not see what they could have done for me."
Benalla also told the newspaper that he had returned his diplomatic passports to the Elysée Palace at the end of August but that they were given back to him with other personal effects in early October by "a member of the presidency." 
"Since they were given back to me, I did not see any reason not to use them." Benalla said.
In a separate interview with digital outlet Mediapart, released on December 31, Benalla said he continued to have regular contact with the President on current affairs, such as the "gilets jaunes," or yellow vest, protest movement.
"They cannot deny it," Benalla told Mediapart. "It will be very hard to do because all these exchanges are on my mobile phone."
The judicial inquiry into the May Day incidents is still ongoing, the Paris prosecutor's office said Thursday.

Seniors are one of the fastest-growing demographics trying weed
It may help with a number of problems that come with age: pain, sleeplessness, a lack of appetite
 (CNN)
An 86-year-old man in a bright yellow sweatshirt and matching baseball cap grips his walker tightly. He stands near the door of a large bus, the charter name American stretching over his shoulder. He greets neighbors and trades jokes with an official-looking woman, clipboard at the ready, checking people in as they board. 
They spot an older woman in black running toward them, her purse bouncing behind her. "Chin," the woman gives her last name when she stops, a little out of breath. "I worried you'd leave without me, and I definitely didn't want to miss this." 
Seniors check in with Kandice Hawes before boarding a charter bus to a medical marijuana dispensary.
She joins about 50 seniors from Laguna Woods Village, an active-lifestyle community in Orange County, California, for people 55 and older, who are already
 
aboard the bus and ready for a new adventure. Many say they saw an ad for the free senior shuttle in their local paper.
They aren't catching a ride to bingo, nor are they headed to walk at the mall. Instead, this special charter comes to the community once a month to spare these seniors a half-hour drive to Santa Ana. Their destination: 
Bud and Bloom
, a store that organizes the shuttle and bills itself as a senior-friendly medical marijuana dispensary.  Some nicknamed the charter "the cannabus."
This is the first trip for the energetic man in yellow, John Lustig, and his spouse, Anne, who knits next to him on the bus. He fell and hurt his back and uses the walker for balance. "I've been having unpleasant back pain, and the medications weren't doing it, so I thought, at 86, I would give cannabis a try," Lustig says. 
Anne Lustig knits as she rides with her husband to the marijuana dispensary.

The retired librarian's doctor gave him a shot for the pain, but it hasn't worked well, and his wife said the opioid he's on doesn't always work, either. 
A lot of other riders expressed reluctance about opioids, worried that they'll feel unmotivated. The group takes the "active" description of their senior community seriously: There are horse trails, pools and tennis. 
Lustig hopes cannabis will help. Asked what neighbors will think, he jokes, "I don't give a damn.
"If I can help them lift something because my back is OK again, I think they would even help pay for the trip." 
On board, the festive atmosphere is punctuated by the buzz of neighbors getting to know each other. One woman looks over a long handwritten shopping list. She's gathered neighbors' requests, and the list is four pages long. Others hand iPhones across the aisle, showing off photos of grandkids and great-grandkids. Many laugh and share stories, learning that they have at least one thing in common: If they've tried the drug before, it was a grandson who introduced them to it.  
The shuttle riders carry long lists of dispensary requests for friends.
"My grandson gave me a block of this chocolate," says a woman with an old Hollywood style coif and a sensible knit vest, a glasses chain around her neck. She asks that her name not be used, saying her children would be mortified. "I couldn't see straight for hours. It made me feel so weird, but I hear that there is some you can get that won't get you high. I'm interested in that. I've got arthritis."   
Arthritis, pain, insomnia, lack of appetite: All problems familiar to seniors and 
problems medical marijuana 
may address. As a result, seniors
are 
one of the fastest-growing demographics 
to show interest in weed, a study showed.
Kandice Hawes, who was checking people in with the clipboard, is a longtime legalization advocate hired by Bud and Bloom. She said that since she's been coordinating the senior shuttle, she's seen a shift in attitudes, especially after marijuana became legal in all forms in California in January. Seniors, she finds, are particularly curious. "We usually have a happy bunch who want to learn something new and to try out new things," she said.  
Scientific studies are still limited due to the Schedule I classification
of the drug, which means it's illegal on the federal level and is considered to be of no medical value. However, the evidence is starting to show otherwise. The seniors on board the "cannabus" -- many new to the drug, many like the Lustigs -- want to find out whether it will work for them. 
Weed has already fixed a huge health issue for Christy Diller, who is going to be 80 in a few months. She's been using it for a couple of years.
Christy Diller, right, says marijuana brownies help her sleep and relieve her arthritis pain.
"I've got rheumatoid arthritis really bad. That's why I'm taking the marijuana," Diller said. She eats a marijuana brownie every night, about two hours before she goes to bed. Before marijuana, she'd get
about only two hours of sleep a night. "I was like a walking zombie, and that was almost every day." Now, with her brownies, she gets a full night's rest. 
Today, she's on the bus to buy mint lozenges. She bought some a few months ago, on another shuttle ride, and found that they helped when the brownies weren't enough. Some friends have given her a hard time about using marijuana, but she doesn't care what they think.
"I think it is great. I think older people that have a lot of pain should use the marijuana, you know. When nothing else helps, then use it," Diller said. "For me, nothing else helped me anymore, so I used the marijuana. It got a little better. It didn't get much better, but it got better. So I can at least get
some steps already, and I can walk. I could not even walk before." 
Christy Diller browses at the medical marijuana shop.
The bus passes through an industrial area and pulls up alongside a set of nondescript concrete buildings. The only thing distinguishing the Bud and Bloom dispensary is a bright green cross in the window and a large man in black, with the air of a bouncer, standing at the door for security.
Inside, the seniors must show an ID and fill out city-required paperwork. At a desk that resembles the check-in area at a doctor's office, they have to state whether they are there for medical or recreational purposes. "If you have a doctor's recommendation, you get a 10% discount here," the clerk tells Diller. "And if you are over 55, you also get a seniors discount."  
Part of the group goes to the back of the building, where there is an information fair. Vendors sell weed wares and services. The Lustigs seem intrigued by a mixture that goes in your morning coffee, and they get a massage from a woman who rubs cannabis oil onto their backs.
Donald Wright, who describes himself as the senior brand ambassador for a cannabis product, explains it to some of the seniors.
Christina Espiritu, founder of the 420 Foodie Club, speaks with a group of seniors as they eat sandwiches in metal folding chairs. "How many of you have ever cooked with marijuana?" Espiritu asks. A few hands shoot up. 
"Do you remember what you made?" she asks. 
"Brownies, of course," shouts a woman, laughing, at the front. 
"Did you like them?" Espiritu asks. 
"No, they tasted like dirt," the woman responds. 
"Well, we can teach you about how you can make marijuana into butter. I promise that tastes a lot better," the instructor tells the class.
Anne Lustig gets a massage with cannabis oil.
Other seniors ask about creams on display. "These do different things for different times of day," says a man with a million-dollar smile who looks like he should work at a high-end cosmetics counter. "The bliss from this is very uplifting, meant for a mood enhancement. It is quite energetic at times, but it is meant to elevate your mood and make you feel good. The other is great for sleep. Even Time magazine wrote about it. There's satisfaction guaranteed."
One woman waits to check out by a display of medical cannabis potato chips.
In the store, a group looks around what could pass for a posh hotel spa rather than a hippie-era head shop. On displays of modern furniture and glass cabinets are cannabis products in every imaginable variety: weed popcorn, potato chips, mints, gummies, lip gloss and the more traditional glass bongs and rolled joints. "These are a little fancier than what we used in the '60s," one man tells his wife as they look over bongs.
Bongs for sale at the dispensary "are a little fancier than what we used in the '60s," one man said.
Clerks and an on-site pharmacist are ready to answer any questions. 
"I do have the oil," a clerk tells the Lustigs. "It would work really well for your back pain. But that's only if you have someone who can assist you."
John Lustig pats the hand of his wife of 64 years with a mischievous grin, and she nods that she will help. "How do you know how much to apply?" he asks the clerk.
"It's very personal. You will have to test the waters," the clerk replies. "The thing about our topicals is, it's not intoxicating."
John and Anne Lustig learn about cannabis lotions at the dispensary.
"Do you have your exit bag?" a nearby clerk asks as Diller checks out. An exit bag is a secure envelope required by state law for all dispensary purchases.
"Oh, you have to bring that every time?" she asks. 
"You have to bring them back every time. It is just the law. It's a dollar."
"Oh, dear. A dollar is a dollar for we seniors," Diller says.
One of the drawbacks of marijuana as medicine: It can be expensive. Diller's tiny box of mints costs $24.49. The clerk blames taxes, and since marijuana is illegal at the federal level, it's not something Medicaid or insurance  covers, even with a doctor;s recommendation. 
Though disappointed about the expense, Diller still thinks the benefits are worth it. "For me, it's a miracle," she says. "Although the cream can smell pretty bad. I went to my daughter one time. She said, 'You smell horrible. What do you have on?' I said 'marijuana.' My daughter laughed and said 'whatever works.' "

A few weeks after their shopping trip, Anne Lustig said they aren't completely sold on marijuana. Before she uses it, she wants to do more research. "Honestly, I haven't given it a chance yet," she said, though she rubbed some of the liquid on her husband's back. "I do think that may have helped, at least a little bit.
"We will have to see. As my husband always says, 'getting old is not for sissies.' "

A CNN crew finds medical personnel trying to save a wounded fighter in Tikrit
But when the man dies, demands start for the crew's video footage
A CNN crew -- correspondent Ben Wedeman, video journalist Mary Rogers and producer Kareem Khadder -- managed to make their way to a hospital in Tikrit while heavy fighting raged around them. Wedeman reports from the scene in this first-person account:
Tikrit, Iraq (CNN)
Two men in blue smocks were mopping up blood spilled in the main entrance to the Dijla Hospital south of Tikrit when we arrived there mid-morning Friday. The air shook with outgoing rockets and artillery roaring toward the center of the city.
We were escorted by men from the Badr Brigade, the biggest and best-organized Iranian-backed force fighting ISIS.
As we got out of our car, a man wearing a vest with the emblem of the Iraqi Red Crescent beckoned urgently to video journalist Mary Rogers to come inside. He led her to a gurney surrounded by four or five men, some wearing blue disposable surgical gowns, others in dark green military fatigues. 
They were huddled over a man naked to the waist, a thick plastic tube inserted in his side, red with blood, leading to a bottle filling up with more blood. The wounded man -- no one knew his name -- had been shot in the head, the chest and the leg. He was motionless.

The head doctor, in dark green combat fatigues, told me the man was in critical condition.
Read More
All the while, the windows of the building shook from the concussion of the bombardment of central Tikrit. From the sound, it was clear that artillery and rocket launchers were nearby.
Several other wounded fighters were in the entrance, but their condition was much less grave. One, who identified himself as Sadiq, had been shot in the upper thigh, but was fully conscious. 
He told producer Kareem Khadder he had been shot in central Tikrit that morning, recalling at the time he was uncertain whether it was shrapnel or a bullet because the fighting was so intense.
While Mary and Kareem were doing that interview, I walked around the hospital to see if there was anything else that might help us put together a report. It was a ramshackle place, it looked like much of the facility had been in a state of neglect for a while, perhaps because until recently it was in no-man's land.
When I went back to see where Mary and Kareem were, I was told Mary was down a corridor where an "operation" was about to take place. Mary was invited to film the operation. I found her putting on a surgical gown and blue shoe covers. 
Effort to save a life fails, argument over video ensues
Several men rolled a gurney through the corridor in our direction. The same critically wounded man was wheeled into a side room. He never made it into the operating theater.
A different set of doctors or medics started working on him, pumping air into his lungs, then applying CPR. His chest took a final heave, as the doctors tried to find a pulse, but there was no pulse to find. There was no "operation." This was a last, desperate attempt to stop this unknown man from dying. His face was yellow and waxy.
He was dead, but the doctors didn't call time of death,
In the meantime, our escorts were calling us to leave, we needed to move to our next destination, which they had told us was the position from which artillery and rocket launchers were at work.
Mary, who was at the far end of the gurney, wedged her way out and we went outside.  She went to the car, I chatted with a pair of Iraqi journalists in the entrance. They had been here for more than two weeks. I bade them farewell, and walked toward our car.
And then, everything changed. I heard a commotion behind me, and the doctor I had spoken to before passed me, shouting, "Grab all the cameras! Get the cameras!"
"What's the problem?" I asked him.
He didn't provide an explanation.
 Harsh words, backed up by guns
"Give us your cameras now!" he barked at me.
 A group of militiamen had surrounded Kareem, and was insisting he give them his small camera.
More militiamen, plus some of the hospital staff gathered around him, shouting angrily that all cameras must be surrendered. Right next to me a tall man with a military shirt over running pants raised his rifle, about to shoot in the air.
Anti-ISIS fighters have new target: Hearts and minds
02:11
This is going to get very messy, I thought to myself.
Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed and there was no shooting. But everyone was very agitated.
Much shouting ensued between our entourage and the local militiamen.
Our chief escort, Ma'in Al-Kadhimi, was gesturing wildly and arguing with them to calm down, but he wasn't having much luck. He is a commander of the Badr Organisation, but these men were with the Soldiers of the Imam Brigade (Kataib Jund Al-Imam in Arabic). It's a separate group, and clearly Al-Kadhimi, who was treated with deference by his own men, didn't enjoy the same esteem here.
In the meantime, I joined Mary in our car, concerned that too many of us arguing with this large group would only make matters worse. Kareem was busy negotiating outside the hospital. We locked the car doors and did our best to pretend we were simply waiting patiently to move.
Soon a group of men armed with AK-47 assault rifles gathered outside the car, knocking on the window and angrily gesturing that we must give them the camera. Mary discreetly pulled out the data card with the footage she had just shot and replaced it with an empty one. It's an old trick that sometimes works in situations like these.  Although I could understand everything this crowd was saying, I feigned ignorance.
This went on for about 45 minutes. Some in our entourage were trying to keep the crowd from banging on the car windows and wrenching open the locked doors.
Kareem hid his small camera in one of the cars and saw the big camera being taken away by several people. Kareem followed the camera to make sure it was safe.
Inside, everyone was shouting, with Kareem refusing to do anything before someone explained what was going on.
The armed men wanted the sequence of the dying fighter deleted, and weren't going to take "no" for an answer. Kareem then went inside one of the rooms to carry on negotiations. Armed men barred Kareem from leaving the room.
Unity against ISIS -- but that's about where it ends
Eventually, Kareem said we should delete the sequence of the dying man, after our Iraqi security guard had said we needed to do just that -- otherwise, we were in trouble.
Kareem looked at the camera and noticed the card was missing. A media-savvy member of the Soldiers of the Imam Brigade insisted we were hiding the card with the footage.
Finally Kareem returned and said that if we didn't hand over the camera there would be trouble. The atmosphere was such that we realized that not handing over the camera would make matters much worse. So we gave Kareem the camera and waited.
 A few minutes later, he returned. They know the data card is empty. They want the one with the pictures, he said.
So we gave it to him. Soon Kareem was back.
"They don't know how to delete the pictures of the dying man," he said. So Mary went with him inside the hospital to delete the footage of the dying man.
To cut a long, tense story short, Mary didn't delete the footage. Someone else did, all the footage from the hospital.
After about an hour and a half, we finally left the hospital compound. Our escort, Al-Kadhimi, was shaken.
He, and we, were reminded that with all the different armed groups fighting on the Tikrit front, there might be unity against ISIS, but that's about where it ends.

Paris (CNN)
France's beleaguered President Emmanuel Macron will hold talks with business leaders and trade unions Monday after a fourth weekend of protests that have challenged his grip on power.
Macron, who will also meet political leaders and local officials, wants to "hear their voices, their proposals and with the aim of mobilizing them to act," a spokeswoman for the Elysee Palace said Sunday.
The meetings will come ahead of Macron's address to the nation which is expected to center around national unity. Macron is anticipated to urge the "gilets jaunes," or "yellow vest" protesters to seek dialogue after a weekend in which 1,723 people were taken in for questioning and 1,220 were taken into custody, according to the Interior Ministry. Across the country, 135 people were reported wounded.
A demonstrator wearing a yellow vest is covered in blood after being injured during a protest in Paris on Saturday.
Macron is facing criticism from both left and right with demonstrators marching against the rise of living costs, the scrapping of the "fortune tax" and accusations that the former banker has done little to address the inequality in French society. 
Further pressure grew over the weekend with police firing rubber bullets and hundreds of canisters of tear gas at the demonstrators, some of whom set vehicles on fire 
during Saturday's protests.

The protests have paralyzed Paris with landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower being closed to the public, some metro stations being closed and sporting events across the country called off.
About 8,000 police were on the streets of Paris and tens of thousands more deployed across the country.
Protesters gather in the Place de la Republique on December 8.
On Sunday, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire claimed the the unrest was creating a "catastrophe" for the French economy.
The French retail sector has suffered a loss in revenue of about $1.1 billion since the beginning of the yellow vest protests last month, according to Sophie Amoros, a spokeswoman for the French retail federation.

"It's a catastrophe for commerce, it's a catastrophe for our economy," Le Maire told reporters as he walked around Paris while surveying the damage wrought by protesters.
The protests, which have stretched as far and wide as the southern cities of Marseille and Toulouse, brought out 136,000 people across the country on Saturday, police said.
Originally a grassroots movement, the "
gilets jaunes
" first emerged online with Facebook events set up by citizens mostly from deprived rural areas.
They began by coordinating road blockades across France to protest the fuel tax hike but the protests have since mushroomed into a broader demonstration of anger against Macron. 
Moisi: France was supposed to be carrier of hope
10:04
Dominique Moisi, a foreign policy expert at the Paris-based Institut Montaigne and a former Macron campaign adviser told CNN the French presidency was not only in crisis but that Europe's future also hung in the balance:
"In a few months from now there will be European elections, and France was supposed to be the carrier of hope and European progress. What happens if it's no longer? If the president is incapacitated to carry that message? And it's about the future of democracy, as well, illiberal democracies are rising all over the world.
"And if Macron fails the future of France risks looking like the presidency of Italy today. And it's much more serious because we have a centralized state which plays a major role in the balance of power within Europe. But make no mistake, it is a French version of a much more global phenomenon." 
Trump faults Paris climate agreement as protests in France continue
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Sunday urged US President Donald Trump to refrain from commenting on the protests in France and not to meddle in the country's domestic policies. 
"I say to Donald Trump, and the President of the Republic [Emmanuel Macron] has also said: we do not take part in American debates, allow us to live our life as a nation," Le Driat told LCI television. 
Trump on Saturday posted two tweets referring to the "yellow vest" anti-government protests, saying the Paris Agreement on climate change wasn't "working out so well for Paris." 
When asked about Trump's remarks, Le Drian also said the US President should "be careful with what he said."
"Most Americans do not agree with his decision to break away from the Paris agreement," he added.

The eight-year drugs war has claimed around 100,000 lives in Mexico
Now federal government policy towards vigilantes appears to be changing
In Antunez, vigilantes show CNN a home that they recently confiscated
In some parts of Mexico, vigilantes are returning property to victims of drugs cartels
The bright yellow front wall of the compound is lined with perfectly pruned palm trees.
Our hosts open a metal gate and usher us inside to a large yard with a fresh-cut lawn, more palm trees and a circular pool in the middle.
The house itself is a two-story dwelling, also painted in bright yellow with white accents and double-paned windows with arched tops and red tile roof.
In any large American city, this house would be a suburban, upper-middle class home -- but here in the town of Antunez, located in a mainly rural area of the Mexican southwestern state of Michoacan, it seems much grander, certainly in stark contrast with the adobe houses next door.
"This is now our barracks," says a vigilante who spoke to us on condition of anonymity. "Some of our guys sleep and eat here. Some took the weapons that used to belong to the trafficker." When we visited, half-a-dozen vigilantes stood guard outside.
Our hosts are a group of local men who rose up in arms against the Knights Templar, a rather romantic name for a criminal organization known not only for drug trafficking, but also for terrorizing people in this part of Mexico through extortion, executions, rape and murder.
The drug war in Mexico, which has been raging since former President Felipe Calderon started fighting back against the cartels in 2006, has claimed 100,000 lives. States like Michoacan are largely in the control of the cartels: 90 per cent of the cocaine that enters the U.S. does so through Mexico. The country is also a major supplier of marijuana, methamphetamine and, more recently, heroin.
The mansion's owner, Efrain Isaac Rosales, also known as "El Tucan" (The Toucan), fled on January 10 when the town rose up in arms against him and his gunmen. They say he left so fast that he even abandoned some of his weapons in the house.
Rosales is a lieutenant under the leadership of Servando Gomez, also known as "La Tuta," the head of the Knights Templar cartel. Some 20 towns have been retaken from the drug gangs, according to the vigilantes, but Gomez, the former schoolteacher-turned-cartel leader, still holds a tight grip over Michoacan, ruling with intimidation and violence. He makes occasional public appearances, handing out money to the poor -- he considers himself an altruist -- and loudly trying to justify his presence in the state. 
"[The Knights Templar] are a necessary evil," he once told an assembled crowd. "Fortunately -- or unfortunately -- we are here. If we weren't, another group would come."

These vigilantes rose up in arms against the Knights Templar, a criminal organization known for drug trafficking and terrorizing people -- through extortion, executions, rape and murder -- in southwestern Mexico. The group gave CNN access to the abandoned mansion of drugs lord Efrain Isaac Rosales.

The vigilantes also confiscated a couple of vehicles which were left at the property: a white, late-model, Dodge Ram pickup truck and a modified truck painted matt black. The latter was fitted with half-inch steel plates: it had signs of having been in a shootout, with bullet holes on the passenger side, the hood and the windshield.

 On a decorative opening in the foyer of his lieutenant's former residence, standing next to a modern art statue, is a mini 14, an assault rifle that fires .223-caliber bullets like an AR15, left behind by Rosales when he fled. This one had a 30-round magazine. The rifle sits next to a bulletproof vest.
From the foyer, a hallway connects to a living area with a large, dark brown leather recliner in the middle. On the wall, there's a rack for a large flat screen TV; but the vigilante groups have looted the house already and many pieces of furniture are missing, giving the residence the feeling of a house whose owners have just moved out. 
It's still clean, with the exception of the bathrooms, but the beds are unmade and there are pieces of furniture and objects in odd places.
The vigilantes are giving us access to what was believed to be Rosales' "family home." It's hard to miss that the house shares two walls with the Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The church is also painted in similar colors: bright yellow and white.
This is not the only property the vigilantes have occupied that used to belong to the cartel lieutenant. He also owned a nearby ranch called "La Ilusion" (The Illusion), which is surrounded by grapefruit trees and hundreds of hectares of avocado trees, the fruit of which has made the state of Michoacan known around the world.
The vigilantes also confiscated a couple of vehicles that were left at the property: a white, late-model, Dodge Ram pickup truck and a modified truck painted matt black. The latter was fitted with half-inch steel plates and shooting portals in the double cabin and in the back. It had signs of having been in a shootout, riddled with bullet holes on the driver's side, the hood and the windshield.
The property also features a shed with white pillars and red tile roof covering a living area with grills and chairs leading to the lawn connecting to the two-level circular pool divided in the middle.
The vigilantes have been accused of looting the properties they have confiscated, and indeed some have been charged with excesses. But they are, by and large, treated as heroes by the people they have agreed to protect. 
 A vigilante in the nearby town of La Huerta, who covers his face with a ski mask and identifies himself as "Juan," says they say they had no option but to rise up in arms to protect their people and lands. "If the government can't help you, you have to help yourself," Juan says. "All we want to do is just pick up the arms so that we can drive them away. After that we're just going to put them down again."
Juan speaks English with a southern American accent. He says he lived in North Carolina from the time he was eight years old and returned to Mexico when he was 20. He's now 24 and a married father of two.
The federal government's attitude towards the vigilante groups appears to be changing too. Once the army and police would round up the irregulars: now the authorities appear to want to legalize them, freeing them up to fight the cartels. 
 Hipolito Mora, the leader of yet another vigilante group in the town of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, says they have kept the movement against organized crime with the same resources the Knights Templar used to attack them in the past.
"With the same resources that used to belong to the Knights Templar, their ranches and properties, we're financing this movement," Mora says. "We did it at first and we continue to do so." 
He remains philosophical about the dangers in which he has placed himself. "I am not afraid. We are all going to die anyway."
The vigilantes are also returning property they say the Knights Templar stole from local people including ranches, lime orchards, wells, farming machinery and vehicles.
The same morning we spoke to Mora, Grace Villa, a town resident, visited to personally thank him for allowing her and her family to recover their lime orchards.
"I think they're doing the right thing," Villa says, "I think it was a very brave thing to do because they stood up for everybody."
Her family, Villa says, had to flee after 30 armed men showed up at their property demanding the title. "They wanted to charge the people who picked lemons and they wanted to charge people who owned houses. The drug cartels were just sucking the money out of everybody and it was just going too far."

Thirty years ago, there were 12 European countries that had a
 net wealth tax
, a type of levy on personal net assets, which can include anything from investments to cars, jewelry, and collectibles. Today, only three of these countries continue to impose such a tax, which has often proven to be an ineffective way to generate revenue and redistribute wealth. 
While European countries have been doing away with this policy, a number of progressive Democrats in the US have begun
 floating this
 as a solution to narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor. 
David Andelman
In France, the solidarity tax on wealth, or ISF, was created in 1982 under socialist President François Mitterrand, targeting individuals with fortunes over 3 million francs -- the equivalent of some 
$517,000
 today. The law was abolished and reinstated over the years, and the threshold was changed as well. Last year, under President Emmanuel Macron, France became the latest European country to shed a comprehensive wealth tax in an effort to halt the flight of wealthy families and attract others who may be seeking a new home in light of Britain's impending departure from the European Union.
Macron followed through on his campaign promise to scrap the ISF, and replaced it with 
a tax on real estate
 over 800,000 euros. Bank accounts, investments, automobiles, yachts, even antique gun collections are now exempt. For many French citizens who are asset-rich but cash poor, the wealth tax had become increasingly onerous as they were forced to come up with hundreds of thousands, even millions of euros in liquid currency to pay the tax man each year.
Macron has sought to ease the tax burden in France and usher in reforms. From an optics point of view, it didn't help that Macron scrapped the wealth tax and proposed tax cuts for businesses while planning a tax hike on a gasoline in an effort to address climate change. The move fueled Macron's image as a 
"president of the rich,"
 and contributed to the anger of 
yellow vest protestors
 that has spilled into the streets, erupted at times in violence, and shaken the foundations of his government.

In the US, Democrats like Elizabeth Warren have proposed their own visions of a possible wealth tax. 
Warren's proposal
 would levy a 2% tax on a family's net worth in excess of $50 million, with an additional 1% tax on net worth that exceeds $1 billion.
Macron will need to do a lot more to silence the protestors
 "My #UltraMillionaireTax would make the richest tippy-top 0.1% of Americans start doing their part for the country that helped make them rich," Warren claimed in a 
tweet
 after announcing her candidacy.  
But wealth taxes are not always effective. They may impact business creation and risk taking. The administrative costs of enforcing a wealth tax, and the risks of driving wealthy taxpayers elsewhere also pose serious challenges, according to a 2018 
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report
. More importantly, the report states, "Wealth taxes often failed to meet their redistributive goals as a result of their narrow tax bases as well as tax avoidance and evasion." 
France is a classic case study of these problems. About 42,000 millionaires left France between 2000 and 2014, according to the financial paper Les Echos. Many of them 
decamped to other countries
 like Belgium or Portugal, which 
boasts
 a flat tax rate of just 28% on income from interest and investments for expats -- and no wealth tax. Eugenio Carreira, a French accountant, pointed out to me that an estimated 15,000 French expatriates have taken up residence in Portugal, many of them eager to flee the French tax system.
Pierre-François Taittinger, of the famed champagne house, said the French tax system 
forced his family to sell
 a controlling stake of the Taittinger brand to the American investment firm Starwood Capital in 2005. "Half of my family left France because of taxes," Taittinger 
told the Washington Post 
in 2006. "They now live in England, Belgium and other countries where they were warmly welcomed -- unlike here." One French tax consultant, Eric Pinchet, estimated that the wealth tax earned the government some $2.6 billion a year, but cost it more than $125 billion in capital flight every year from 1998 to 2006.
On taxes, Ocasio-Cortez has the right impulse but the wrong remedy
The main reason Macron decided to do away with the wealth tax -- in what could turn out to be a politically catastrophic decision-- was to lure families like the Taittingers and their fortunes back to France. Doing so was also part of a wider attempt to make the country more attractive to British businesses, financial firms and their wealthy managers after Brexit, with the potential to create thousands of jobs for French workers. 
Yellow vest protesters took to the streets again on Saturday and Macron has sought, with little success, to 
show them
 that tax cuts can lead the country down a path to more investments and jobs. 
And even without the wealth tax, French citizens are still saddled with a slew of others. "We are champions of the tax," smiled Carreira, who then proceeded to list a value-added-tax (VAT); taxes on all earnings, interest, and capital gains; and a fuel tax that leaves gas at the pump approaching 
$6 per gallon
. There's also an 
inheritance tax
 and certain 
habitation taxes
, which Macron has endeavored to peel away. 
This brings us back to one key warning from the OECD when it comes to levying a wealth tax -- it's not an efficient way to generate revenue or redistribute wealth in countries that already have robust income, inheritance and gift taxes. The US already imposes these, and an additional wealth tax would likely backfire.
"From both an efficiency and equity perspective, there are limited arguments for having a net wealth tax on top of broad-based personal capital income taxes and well-designed inheritance and gift taxes," the OECD concludes.

How badly do American voters want to take from the wealthy and live with the consequences? I should point out that I, myself, am not even close to being subjected to any wealth tax. Still, I've seen a close-up of the negative consequences in France and other neighboring countries. Considering the pitfalls of the wealth tax in European countries, it seems that the US would be foolhardy to follow in their footsteps.

Story highlights
 Daughter of slain groundskeeper "is not expected to survive," school leader says 
Police had contact with gunman when he was a juvenile in 2006
Gunman and a relative were enrolled in college in 2010
Gunman kills SUV driver near campus and then a woman near school library
The gunman's rampage began at a home in this beachfront city, where two were found dead inside. Then he carjacked a woman and fired at a public bus. It all ended when police shot him dead at Santa Monica College as students studied for finals, a mile from the house.
His blood trail, however, left four people dead Friday in Santa Monica, which abuts Los Angeles and is renowned for its liberal openness.
A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Saturday that the gunman had suffered mental health issues. A couple of years ago, he was hospitalized for treatment after allegedly talking about harming someone, according to the official.
It's not clear whether the state government or his family committed him for treatment or whether he committed himself. It's also unclear under what circumstances he was released. 
Authorities have found no link to domestic or international terror, the official added.
The gunman has been identified, but his name won't be released until authorities reach his family members, who are believed to be outside the United States, city Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks said Saturday.
The gunman and a family member had been enrolled in the college as recently as 2010. The gunman, 23, would have turned 24 on Saturday, Seabrooks said.
Police had contact with the gunman in 2006, but because he was a juvenile then, authorities couldn't release further information Saturday, Seabrooks said.
One of the four persons killed in Friday's shooting rampage was shot outside the library of Santa Monica College, college Police Chief Albert Vasquez said.
Another victim shot dead was identified as Carlos Navarro Franco, 68, who resided in one of Los Angeles' west neighborhoods near Santa Monica, authorities said. He was the driver of an SUV who was gunned down on the campus, police said.
Franco was with his youngest daughter, Marcela, who was going to buy textbooks for her studies at California State University, Dominguez Hills, Santa Monica College President Chui Tsang said in a statement Saturday.
The daughter, 26, was shot and is in critical condition at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center "and is not expected to survive," said Tsang.
Alfred Creollo, a relative who lives in the same building as the family, said that Carlos Franco had worked as a groundskeeper and been with Santa Monica College for 30 years -- though he wasn't working the day of the shooting.
This isn't the first tragedy to hit the family, Tsang notes: Carlos Franco's son died two summers ago in a car accident.
"He was a dedicated husband, dedicated to his family, he was a good person," Creollo said. "We lived here together for 30 years. It was just a devastating blow to hear what happened to him."
The three other victims have not yet been identified.
The two-year college remained closed Saturday as police combed the crime scene for clues to the rampage, which began shortly before noon at an acquaintance's house in one of Santa Monica's breezy neighborhoods.
The gunman, shot by police, died of multiple gunshot wounds, the Santa Monica police chief said.
Investigators are still trying to determine the motive in the shootings that left five people wounded, Seabrooks told reporters Saturday. A woman is in grave condition and her prognosis is not good, Seabrooks said.
The gunman had addresses connected to the house where the rampage began and to a residence in Los Angeles' Palms neighborhood, Seabrooks said.
The shooting spree at several locations in Santa Monica lasted 13 minutes, though the house was apparently set afire before the shooting began, police said.
Given that gunman was wearing a ballistic vest and heavily armed, "I would say it's premeditated," said Seabrooks, who estimated that the shooter had some 1,300 rounds of ammunition during the spree.
Dressed in black and toting an assault-style rifle, the man's apparently random gunfire became the nation's latest disturbing killing spree, ending with his death in the college library and leaving this tourist beachfront city reeling with shock.
A neighbor's account
Jerry Cunningham stepped onto her porch when she heard the shots. She saw the gunman firing at a neighboring house, which was also on fire.
The neighborhood, regarded as working class, sits beside Interstate 10 -- "the last affordable area in Santa Monica," with houses under $1 million, said nearby resident Carmen Franco, 47, who's not related to the killed victim. "Nobody can afford to buy now here in Santa Monica," where houses are easily seven figures, she added. The area's only trailer park is on the other side of the highway.
Investigators believe the gunman knew the dead people in the house, but police were unsure of the connection. The fire began in the front room of the 1,000-square-foot house, and the two bodies were found in a back room, Fire Chief Scott Ferguson said. No accelerant was found, he added.
Cunningham then observed the gunman force at gunpoint a woman to stop her car.
Another car approached. The gunman waved it by, Cunningham said. That driver, also a woman, hesitated for just a moment, and the gunman "fired three shots directly into her and the car," Cunningham said. 
The motorist was wounded in the shoulder, she said. That driver was hospitalized and is in stable condition, authorities said.
The gunman then got into the first car and forced the woman to drive off with him, police said.
During their ride, 911 calls poured in, keeping police on the gunman's path, said Sgt. Richard Lewis, a spokesman for the Santa Monica police.
As the car headed toward the campus of the community college, where 30,000 students are registered, he opened fire on a passing bus, slightly wounding three people, Lewis said.
He was carrying an "AR-15 style rifle," pistols and "more clips for the rifle," Lewis said. 
Police have described the shooter as a 25- to 30-year-old man who was dressed in black and wearing a tactical vest.
As the car pulled onto the campus, the man fired into Franco's red SUV, killing him and critically wounding his passenger, police said. Franco's vehicle crashed after the shooting, Lewis said.
The gunman then abandoned the hijacked vehicle -- leaving the driver unhurt -- and fled on foot, shooting at police, Lewis said.
On campus
College employee Joe Orcutt saw the firefight between the man and officers and took off running, but ran the wrong way and found himself facing the gunman.
"He looked over at me, and I looked at him," Orcutt said. "He just panned his gun and trained it on me, and I just jumped behind the building and he shot at me."
The gunman was "very calm, not running around." He was just "looking around for targets very casually," he said.
"He just looked like he was standing there posing for the cover of an ammo magazine or something. It was bizarre."
Inside a classroom
Jasmine Franco, 22, was in a classroom at Santa Monica College -- next to the library -- waiting for her English class to start at noon on Thursday. Little did she know that the gunman began his rampage at a house near to where she and her mother, Carmen, live.
Jasmine Franco's friend had left the room to fill his water bottle and she was sitting alone when she first became aware something was wrong. "You could hear rumbling, a lot of rumbling, it sounded like an earthquake or something," she said, referring to the sounds of gunfire mixed with the footfalls of people running.
But her 11 classmates and the teacher appeared oblivious, and continued their banter until her friend burst back in. "His whole face was red and his veins were coming out of his neck, he was trying to calm himself," Franco said.
"I'm entirely serious," she said he told them. "There's a shooter on campus."
He told the class he had heard a gun unload. "He said it just sprayed and unloaded tons of rounds."
Not knowing what to do, "We just sat there."
The teacher left the classroom to see what he could learn and, moments later, ran back inside. "He says, 'They just unloaded a magazine.' He said there was a lot of bullets."
At that moment, the door to the hallway locked shut -- automatically -- with a click, she said. Outside the classroom, she could see dozens of people fleeing on the cement. "We could see people running with their backpacks," Franco said. "No screaming, just running. We could just hear feet and running."
Inside the library
As the killer ran, he fatally shot a woman, then burst into the campus library, said Santa Monica Police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks.
Another woman -- who asked not to be identified -- said she was in the building when she heard a gunshot. She took off.
In a hallway, she saw a dark-haired man in black combat boots who she initially thought was a police officer, but quickly realized was the shooter. The man was walking quietly and casually.
She and a colleague ran; gunshots rang out.
Priscilla Morales said that, when she and her friends looked out a library window and saw people running, they grabbed their belongings and prepared to leave, too, but didn't get far. "As we open the door, we hear three gunshots," she said.
So they closed the door and hid.
"I was so scared and thought literally I was going to die," she said.
"Drop it!" she heard police say, then heard gunshots and a man's screams.
The officers had shot the gunman, Lewis said.
Police said that, with the exception of his first two victims in the off-campus house, all of the other victims appear to have been chosen at random.
"My heart goes out to the families of the victims of these tragic shootings in Santa Monica, and I am praying for the recovery of those who were injured," said U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California.
At the time of the shootings, President Barack Obama was in Santa Monica for a fundraiser a 10-minute drive from the campus, CNN affiliate KCAL/KCBS reported. His schedule was not affected.
Back in the classroom
Franco's classroom ended up waiting three hours before police arrived.
During that time, some students followed events on Twitter, but the reports of people being shot and a house burned down seemed unconnected and far-fetched. "Everything's hearsay," Franco said. "People tell you one thing, but you have no clue what's happening. You just don't know anything. The best thing to do is not worry about it. Sit down."
People kept opening the classroom door, which infuriated Franco. "You're not supposed to open the door," she said. "I'm just like, 'No, we're not going to do that.'"
Though they could see police from classroom windows, "no one came to check on us" for more than two hours, she said.
Tan-uniformed officers with big guns finally arrived and escorted students out with their hands on their heads for security -- "like inmates," Franco said. Officers shouted "Go! Go! Go!" 
But at least the class was safe.
Franco called her mother, who also drove home some classmates whose cars were inaccessible behind yellow police tape.
"I went home and fell asleep," Franco said.

Paris (CNN)
Crowds of "gilets jaunes" or "yellow vest" protesters gathered Saturday in Paris for a fifth consecutive weekend of demonstrations despite 
concessions this week by French President Emmanuel Macron
.
But their numbers were lower than in previous weeks, with some perhaps appeased by Macron's promises, while others may have been deterred by cold, wet weather or shaken by the 
terror attack
 earlier this week on a Christmas market in Strasbourg.

By midafternoon Saturday, about 34,000 protesters had turned out across France, including more than 2,000 in Paris, according to the Interior Ministry. Last week, some 77,000 protesters turned out across the country, including 10,000 in Paris.
Paris police estimates earlier Saturday put the number of protesters in the capital at several thousand.
Some 69,000 police officers were deployed across the country in anticipation of the protests, including 8,000 in Paris, the Interior Ministry said.

Police used tear gas on the Champs-Elysées in confrontations with protesters. Some were seen throwing rocks at security forces.
More than 100 people were in police custody for questioning early Saturday, Paris police said, much fewer than last week. The protests are named after the yellow high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their vehicles.
Paris department stores such as the Galeries Lafayette and Printemps are open this weekend as well as the Louvre museum and Eiffel Tower. Parts of the Champs-Elysées also reopened to traffic midmorning Saturday.
Speaking to CNN French affiliate BFMTV, Maxime Nicolle, a spokesman for the "gilets jaunes," called for a citizens' referendum. "We are protesting peacefully, but Mr. President give us back our freedom and our sovereignty!" he said.

Macron promises social reforms
On December 8, many Paris tourist hot spots and stores were shuttered in anticipation of 
violent protests
 after the previous week's demonstrations resulted in the worst riots to hit the French capital in decades. By the 
end of last weekend
, 1,723 people had been taken in for questioning and 1,220 into custody, according to the Interior Ministry. Across the country, 135 people were reported injured.

Under increasing pressure to respond, Macron may have taken some of the heat out of the protests when he pledged Monday night to increase the minimum wage and scrap new pension taxes. 
In a televised address to the nation, Macron said the violent protests -- which have morphed from a grassroots movement against fuel tax hikes into disparate demonstrations against his presidency -- have been "unacceptable" and "will not be in any way indulged."
He proposed some social reforms, including an increase in the minimum wage by 100 euros ($113) a month beginning in January that will not cost employers extra and a promise that overtime hours will not be taxed. Macron also remained defiant and said he would not reinstate the wealth tax but would fight tax fraud.

'Profound' anger
Journalist and political commentator Agnès Poirier told CNN that the anger felt by protesters, many of them lower middle class from more rural areas, remained "profound." 
Who are the 'yellow vest' protesters causing chaos in France?
But she said the measures announced by Macron -- and his televised appearance during which he seemed more humble and heartfelt than before -- may have swayed some people.
"We will see if the French are still supporting the movement, but also if the 'yellow vests' are ready to stop demonstrating and structure themselves," said Poirier, referring to the grassroots nature of the movement, which has no leadership and has largely been organized through social media.
"They need to structure themselves to meet with the government and go to the table to start negotiating."
"Yellow vest" demonstrators face riot police officers Saturday in the French capital. 
The reforms are expected to cost the government between $8.1 billion and $10.1 billion, Olivier Dussopt, France's secretary of state to the Ministry of Public Action and Accounts, told BFMTV.
Macron visited the Christmas market in Strasbourg on Friday evening to express his gratitude to members of the emergency services after this week's deadly attack there. Police killed the 
suspected attacker 
Thursday evening in the city following a two-day manhunt. Four people have died following Tuesday's attack.

Paris (CNN)
France is bracing for another weekend of protests that could rock Paris and other parts of the country.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said the government was deploying 89,000 security force members across France -- including 8,000 in the capital -- in case the demonstrations turn violent again. 
Many of Paris' famed sites -- including the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower, the Musée Delacroix and the Paris Opera -- will close over the weekend in advance of the protests, organized by the "gilets jaunes," or "yellow vest" movement. The name comes from the high-visibility yellow vests that drivers are required to keep in their vehicles for safety reasons.
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner vowed to deploy all the means available to ensure the latest protests are not hijacked by what he called "a small minority" who have been "radicalized and fallen into violence and hate."
The Eiffel Tower will be closed to visitors over the weekend because of expected "yellow vest" protests.
"We have to guarantee the safety of protesters and the right of citizens to move around freely," Castaner told a news conference Friday.

Stores along the famed Champs-Elysées have also been advised to remain shut. Shop owners were boarding up stores Friday amid fears of further disorder.
The French retail sector has suffered a loss in revenue of about $1.1 billion since the beginning of the yellow vest protests last month, a spokeswoman for the French retail federation, Sophie Amoros, told CNN. 
Amid heightened tensions, police seized 28 petrol bombs and three homemade explosive devices Friday at an area blockaded by protesters in Montauban in southern France, a spokesman for the Tarn-et-Garonne prefecture told CNN.
On Friday, Paris' public transport operator, RATP, announced on its website that 36 Metro stations would be closed Saturday. It also said 50 bus lines will have limited to no service.

Protester not backing down
Some 630 people were arrested and more than 260 injured, including 81 police officers, in 
last weekend
's protests nationwide, the third consecutive week of such demonstrations.
There have been four accidental deaths, according to officials. Three resulted from traffic accidents related to the blockades, and the fourth was that of an 80-year-old woman who died in Marseille after being hit by a tear gas canister that came through her window.

The demonstrations began as a form of grassroots opposition to rising gas prices and planned increases in taxes on polluting forms of transport, but they have evolved into broader protests against President Emmanuel Macron's government. 
Macron appeared to back down Wednesday, announcing that the fuel tax planned for January -- as part of measures to combat climate change -- would not be introduced in 2019. But the movement now appears to be about more than just taxes; it's exposed the growing divide between Paris' metropolitan elite and the country's rural poor. 
Maxime Nicolle, a member of the gilets jaunes from rural Brittany, told CNN: "I'm definitely not backing down now. The moratorium is useless. The people want a referendum, a referendum on Macron, the Senate and the National Assembly."
Street furniture, such as railings around trees, public bicycle stations and benches, will be removed from parts of Paris ahead of the expected protests so they can't be used as weapons, Mayor Anne Hidalgo said.
Municipal buildings will be closed, and services "mobilized and determined to ensure everyone's protection," she said. In an appeal to protesters, the mayor added, "Please take care of Paris, because Paris belongs to all the French people."
High school students demonstrate Friday at the Place de la Republique in Paris over education reforms.
On Friday, Benoit Potterie, a member of Parliament from Macron's En Marche party, wrote on Twitter that he received a bullet by mail and said that 
a note accompanying it
 contained the message, "Next time, it will be between your eyes."
In response to the threat, the lawmaker tweeted: "I have always been open to dialogue but these threats are unacceptable. I will not be intimidated and continue my work as a Member of Parliament with the same motivation, the general interest and the same method: exchange and dialogue."
It wasn't clear who sent the bullet.
Unrest spreads to schools 
Many of those demonstrating have moved to the suburbs due to rising real estate prices. Suburban protesters, like those from rural areas, argue they're disproportionately affected by the now-shelved gas tax, as they rely on gas and cars much more than city dwellers.
Castener, the interior minister, said he had talked to protesters and had some sympathy with their concerns and economic troubles. 
But, he said, the French government had made appropriate gestures. "The Prime Minister opened the door, and canceled the environment tax," he said. 
High schoolers set a barricade on fire to block a tramway during a protest Wednesday in Bordeaux.
The unrest has spread to hundreds of high schools across the country, where students are demonstrating against recent education reforms.
More than 140 people were arrested Thursday outside a school in the Paris suburb of Mantes-la-Jolie after protesters clashed with police.
Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer 
told radio station France Inter
 on Friday that he, like many others, had been shocked by images of students in Mantes-la-Jolie being made to kneel with their hands behind their heads by security forces. But he said that elements from outside the schools had used the situation to stir up trouble and attack security forces.
Police detain students Thursday in Mantes-la-Jolie after clashes with security forces.
Castaner said 12 officers were present to bring the situation under control, which was reflected in the methods they used.
Meanwhile, La Voix du Nord newspaper in northern France reported that a 
bottle containing acid
 had been thrown Friday at one of its journalists and a fellow reporter while they were covering a high school protest in the town of Wingles, in the Pas-de-Calais department. The two narrowly managed to avoid being hit, the paper said.
Presidency in crisis
It's unclear if the gilets jaunes demonstrations will be as violent or as large this weekend. The number of 
protesters peaked last month
 at 282,000, according to the Interior Ministry, but has been slowly on the decline, with 136,000 taking part Sunday.
Since the first protests were held in mid-November, 1,648 people have been injured, including 552 police officers, the Interior Ministry said. More than 1,600 people have been taken in for questioning and 1,387 arrested. 
Macron will not speak publicly before this weekend's protests, the press office for the presidency said Friday. Macron is resisting pressure from protesters and politicians to speak sooner to calm tensions ahead of time. 
Macron's top-down approach to fighting climate change serves as a cautionary tale
Dominique Moisi, a foreign policy expert at the Paris-based Institut Montaigne and a former Macron campaign adviser, told CNN the French presidency was not only in crisis but that Europe's future also hung in the balance.
"In a few months from now, there will be European elections, and France was supposed to be the carrier of hope and European progress. What happens if it's no longer? If the President is incapacitated to carry that message?" Moisi asked.
"It's about the future of democracy, as well; illiberal democracies are rising all over the world. And if Macron fails, the future of France risks looking like the presidency of Italy today. And it's much more serious because we have a centralized state, which plays a major role in the balance of power within Europe. 
"But make no mistake, it is a French version of a much more global phenomenon."

Paris (CNN)
A prominent figure in France's gilets jaunes, or "yellow vest," movement was seriously wounded during a protest in Paris on Saturday. 
Jerome Rodrigues, a self-described pacifist, was injured in his right eye by a projectile hurled towards him, allegedly by police.
In an interview with French broadcaster LCI on Sunday, Rodrigues said that he had stayed in Paris' Place de la Bastille to encourage fellow yellow vest demonstrators to leave the area as skirmishes between the Black Bloc -- another group of protesters often associated with anarchy and violent skirmishes -- and the police, escalated.
Rodrigues' lawyer Philippe de Veulle told CNN affiliate BFM TV that he believes that a flash ball  -- a controversial "less lethal" hand-held weapon launcher deployed by French police in riots -- injured him.
French police said the watchdog agency the General Inspectorate of National Police (IGPN) had launched an investigation into the case of "an injured man rescued on Bastille Square."

Rodrigues's lawyer said he had evidence to give the IGPN.
"I have material elements in the sense that it's a Flash Ball shot. The Flash Ball will be handed over to the IGPN Divisional Commissioner, who contacted my client's sister last night," de Veulle told BFM TV.
Flash Ball is a French-made trademarked projectile whose manufacturer, Verney-Carron Security, calls it a "non-lethal 44mm-gauge weapon... versatile, adaptable, but always effective."
The incident was captured by Rodrigues, as he was livestreaming the protest, on his Facebook page. The video has been watched over 1.4M times and shared by 67,000 users. 
Shortly after the incident, Rodrigues posted a photo to his Facebook account that said: "I am going to lose my eye, fam."
The protests -- named after the yellow high-visibility jackets French motorists must carry in their vehicles -- started November 17 in reaction to an eco-tax on gas but have since morphed into broader demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron and his government. 
Last month, 
a pressurized Macron
 pledged to increase the minimum wage and get rid of new pension taxes. But the move has done little to appease the anger felt by some hard-core protesters.
'No one is in charge here': How yellow vest protests spread, and why Macron's struggling to keep up
Saturday marked the 11th consecutive week of the demonstrations. A French Interior Ministry spokesperson told CNN that approximately 69,000 people marched on Saturday in solidarity with the yellow vest movement, including 4,000 protesters in Paris. 
"I am a hyper pacifist, I do not want anyone to get hurt," Rodrigues said. "I was there to make sure my little yellow guys could get out of this hell."
Rodrigues gave further details on the incident, saying that that he had been to the hospital and awaits further guidance from doctors regarding his injury.
"It's very painful. I'm waiting for the doctors to come and tell me what it is. It's my right eye, and I think I stayed in the operating room for seven or eight hours," Rodrigues said.
Rodrigues is planning on filing a complaint to the police, LCI reported. 
"I was deliberately targeted. I am a figure of the movement, at least in the Paris protests, and police pointed their fingers at me many times during previous demonstrations, so I think they knew very well who they were shooting at," Rodrigues told BFM TV Sunday.
Ten people have died
 in connection with the protests, with most deaths taking place in traffic accidents related to blockades in November and December.
On Sunday, 10,500 people marched in the French capital for the so-called "foulards rouges" or "red scarfs" protest, in opposition to the ongoing yellow vest demonstrations, according to the Paris Police Department.

Castellanos: Chris Christie is a force but not yet a leader
The 2012 GOP convention in Tampa has just ended. It is not too early, however, to draw a few conclusions. 
My takeaways from this fine event are as follows:
Ann Romney added dimension to Mitt Romney.  We see more in him now, through her eyes, if not our own.
Paul Ryan passed the first and most important test of a VP nominee, "Do no harm."  Ryan did not say he could see the deficit from his porch.
Ryan helps because he adds the prospect of action and reform to the ticket, helping lead them into the future.  He is an agent of change.  What Barack Obama had last time in a slogan, "hope and change," Mitt Romney has now in a running mate.
Alex Castellanos
Condoleezza Rice would have been a great VP pick and needs to be somewhere in a Romney administration.  This woman can play more than golf.
Susana Martinez is moving up fast on the outside rail for national office but has a long way to go.
President Obama tried to send Joe Biden to Tampa, but our VP had to cancel because of the storm.  Both the Obama campaign and Republicans were disappointed.

Conventions are ridiculously overburdened with security.  Note to the Secret Service: If you put "Secret Service" on your vest in big yellow letters, it is no longer a secret.
When you start talking about humanizing your candidate, you are dehumanizing your candidate.
If Obama loses, "you didn't build that" may become the biggest gaffe in presidential campaign history, and the most revealing, too.
If nothing else, the Christie speech proved we are the party of the Big Tent.
There is a great bar in Ybor City, the Bad Monkey.  You don't have to bring a bad monkey to enter.  They have plenty and, upon request, will fly a screaming "bad monkey" for you.
Conventions, as part of a campaign, have to change what people think. Nearly 70% of Americans think we are on the wrong track.  Chris Christie told us we were on the wrong track. If you tell voters what they already know, they stay where they already are.
Wisconsin may lose a congressman, but Romney has gained a son.  If anything happens to Romney, Ryan will become president and inherit one-sixth of Romney's money.
Rand Paul's speech was chloroform via teleprompter.  He lacks his father's wit and humor.  The next lap of Paulites are in big trouble.
In politics, winning isn't everything: You can still lose by winning the wrong war.  Republicans may win the war over Medicare while they should be fighting a more relevant conflict, the war to create jobs and growth.
Ryan is a catfish noodler.  He wades into a muddy river, sticks his hand in a catfish's mouth and pulls it out of a hole.  We now have a perfectly balanced ticket because my guess is Romney has never done that.
The next Republican to place a convention in a hurricane zone in August will have his head held under water for the duration of any storm.
Chris Christie may be a force, but he is not yet a leader.  Babe Ruth, disappointingly, bunted.
Marco Rubio is "The Natural." The most important part of his wonderful speech was its generosity.  He toned his speech down to serve his primary purpose. Rubio set up the man he was nominating, Romney.
Clint Eastwood can't do improv.  He may have hurt Clint Eastwood, but he didn't hurt Mitt Romney.  If Woody Allen is right and 80% of success is showing up, then Eastwood was successful.  Joe Six Pack in Ohio will remember that Gunnery Sergeant Highway showed up.
Mitt Romney's speech met the moment.  It left the impression that a good and decent family man is ready to go to work.  That may be enough.  It framed this year's choice in a thought:  "President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet. My promise ... is to help you and your family."
At some point in a debate, Obama is going to turn and challenge Romney, saying, "Mitt, you have nothing new to offer.  In fact, on social issues, foreign policy, taxes, spending, Medicare and everything else, you have nothing different to offer than taking us back to what George Bush proposed.  That's what got us into this mess."  Romney has yet to answer that question.  He has until the first presidential debate October 3, in Denver, to find a response.
Conventions are fading into the past, and this may be the last great parade of GOP elephants.  Any convention that can be shortened to three days can be abridged to two days, one day and then none.
Lastly, New Democrats have, for the first time, a counterpart:  In Tampa in 2012, the New Republican was born.  It turns out, we do believe in evolution.
Stay tuned.  We have 67 days yet to go.

Paris (CNN)
Recent weeks have seen black swastikas scrawled across portraits of Auschwitz survivor, Simone Veil; 96 tombs at a Jewish cemetery defaced in eastern France; and the words, "Dirty Zionist sh*t!", hurled in anger at 
French philosopher Alain Finkielkraut
 by a man wearing a fluorescent yellow vest. 
These are but a few of the anti-Semitic attacks that have blighted the country in recent months. Home to Europe's largest Jewish community, France has seen a 
74% rise in anti-Semitic incidents
 over the past year, according to French authorities. French President Emmanuel Macron has gone as far as to say that anti-Semitism is at its worst levels in France and in other parts of Europe since World War II.
'I'm scared for the future of my baby here': French Jews live in fear amid rising anti-Semitic acts
Studies have shown anti-Semitism is rising sharply across Europe but this violent resurgence in France has triggered some deep soul-searching with many asking: what's behind it? Why now? Some have questioned the Yellow Vest movement and whether its radical fringe is partly to blame for the sudden uptick. 
"Anti-Semitism was going strong before the yellow vests, but it's even stronger today thanks to some of them," the head of the French Council of Jewish Institutions, Francis Kalifat, said last month.
"Gilets Jaunes, Colere Noir" is a popular slogan among the leaderless movement, meaning "Yellow Vests, Black Rage." For almost four months it's this rage that has poured out along the Champs Elysees, shattering shop windows, leaving police officers wounded and symbolically knocking the Marianne, a national figure who embodies the French Republic, off her perch.

Protesters rally against anti-Semitism in France after more graves vandalized
Vitriol previously expressed in anonymous tweets has materialized in large letters plastered across the Arc de Triomphe monument for all to see. Offensive mutterings that were confined to the home have been amplified and have now taken center stage, as protesters scream their lungs out on live television. France has seen an unprecedented public expression of hate, where nothing now seems to be off-limits. 
The Yellow Vests are not an anti-Semitic movement per se but in a climate where every voice is considered legitimate, anti-Jewish sentiment has found a prominent platform. Thierry-Paul Valette, a spokesman for the Yellow Vests, rejects the accusation that the movement has empowered hate speech. "We didn't fuel anti-Semitism or hate, we simply put a mirror up to society," Valette says. 
"Yes, there are racists, homophobes and anti-Semites in our ranks but that's only a reflection of the French population as a whole."
Graves at the Jewish cemetery in Quatzenheim, near Strasbourg, France, have been desecrated with swastikas.
Nazi salute in reverse
France has a chequered and painful past with anti-Semitism. Even before the Nazi collaboration of the Vichy regime there was 
the Dreyfus affair
, the case of a Jewish army captain who was wrongly accused of spying for Germany: a miscarriage of justice rooted in blatant anti-Semitism that divided France at the end of the 19th century. 
And since the 1990s, a virulent left-wing anti-Semitism has flared up, mirroring the peaks and troughs of violence in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And on the right, nationalist anti-Semitism has been embodied by Jean-Marie Le Pen, a convicted Holocaust denier and founder of the National Front. 
There's no doubt that the far-left and right have been a part of the Yellow Vest movement. Pictures and videos of demonstrators performing the "quenelle," a downward pointing gesture believed by some to be a Nazi salute in reverse, have emerged online.

The quenelle was invented by French stand-up comedian Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, a controversial entertainer who's 
been spotted
 at Yellow Vest protests alongside Jean-Marie Le Pen's former speech writer, 
Alain Soral
. 
Both men have been convicted of anti-Semitism several times. Dieudonne has been charged with "inciting hatred" due to "homophobic, racist and anti-Semitic" comments made during one of his performances in Belgium, and has several convictions in France for making anti-Semitic comments. Soral has also been charged with inciting hatred of Jews because of an anti-Semitic article he posted on his website. 
Dieudonne and Soral regularly appear on their YouTube channels donning Yellow Vests and encouraging their followers -- who are in the hundreds of thousands -- to overthrow "bankers" and "Zionist powers."
Alain Finkielkraut, whose Polish-Jewish father survived deportation to Auschwitz, told the French press he sees the influence of both Dieudonne and Soral in the rise of anti-Semitism. "We mustn't underestimate their influence. Their dream is to unify a multi-cultural France behind a hatred of the Jews," 
he said
.
Finkielkraut, was a strong supporter of the Yellow Vest movement when it started, although he now believes the protest is "grotesque" and should stop because "the violence and hatred have gone too far."
Over the past 15 years Rabbi Nissim Sultan has lost a significant part of his congregation in Grenoble because of anti-Semitism. He says the rise in conspiracy theories has played a huge part: "There's increasing distrust. With globalization and the fight between social classes, old stereotypes have returned," Sultan said. "It's during times of unrest that people look for a scapegoat so here we are again because we're a familiar figure to blame." 
Anti-Semitism has surged in recent years in France. A man holds a placard reading "I am afraid but I am here" during a gathering on Place de la Republique in January 10, 2016 in Paris.
Minority tars Yellow Vest movement
Conspiracy theories are popular with the Yellow Vests. Their distrust of the mainstream media has pushed many of them into social media echo chambers. Videos about the Rothschilds, the famous Jewish banking dynasty, have been widely circulated on Yellow Vest Facebook pages. 
A study conducted
 by the Fondation Jean Jaures shows 31% of people who identify as Yellow Vest supporters believe the US government was involved in 9/11 and a whopping 50% of those who participated in a Yellow Vest protest said they believed in a "global Zionist conspiracy."
Macron says anti-Semitism is at worst levels since World War Two 
Historian Pierre Birnbaum says the whole movement shouldn't be tarred with the same brush but he sees a crossover between the Yellow Vest ideology and anti-Semitism. "It's a movement against the elite, against globalization, against banks," he said. "All of this relies on the same stereotypical elements to do with money which can awaken a feeling of anti-Semitism." 
In the wake of these anti-Jewish attacks President Emmanuel Macron announced a crackdown on the "scourge" of anti-Semitism and said a draft law would be presented to parliament in May aimed at tackling online hate speech. "Anti-Zionism is one of the modern forms of anti-Semitism," Macron declared controversially, adding that in response, France will adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of anti-Semitism.  
A handful of senior Yellow Vests have publicly denounced anti-Semitism within the movement and several also took part in what the organizers estimated was a 20,000-strong demonstration against anti-Semitism last month. But in a movement with no clear organization or cohesion, there is yet to be a collective disavowing of anti-Semitism, with many of the self-proclaimed leaders remaining silent.
Yellow Vest turnout has been dwindling and the movement's wider support has waned significantly. But Friday will mark the beginning of a three-day sit-in held in Paris, climaxing with a large protest on the weekend of March 16/17 to mark four months since the movement began. Some worry that the moderate majority may be once again overshadowed by a radical and dangerous minority.

French President Emmanuel Macron has asked Prime Minister Edouard Philippe to meet with heads of political parties and representatives of the so-called "yellow vests" in an attempt to defuse tensions that erupted into violent protests over the weekend.
Around 36,000 people took part in protests across the country on Saturday, but while the turnout was lower than the previous two weekends, protesters clashed with police, torching cars, erecting roadblocks and burning barricades. 
The unrest has transformed from dissent over rising gas prices and eco-taxes into a broader demonstration against Macron, his government, and tensions between the metropolitan elite and rural poor.
Speaking on France's Europe 1 radio Sunday, spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said the government was considering "all options" to prevent "serious outbursts of violence," including introducing a state of emergency.
A burned-out car sits in a Paris street the day after riots spread through the city.
Griveaux said that between 1,000 and 1,500 people joined Saturday's demonstrations "only to fight with the police, to break and loot." He added that those protesters "have nothing to do with the yellow vests."

Yellow vests or "gilets jaunes" refers to the high visibility vests drivers in France are required to keep in their cars for safety reasons, should their cars break down.
Almost 400 people were arrested in Saturday's riots. 
As part of his response, Macron has asked the Ministry of the Interior to develop a policing plan to counter any further protests, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV.  No date has yet been set for the meeting between Philippe and the yellow vests, BFMTV reported.

The protests were initially conceived in response to rising fuel prices. The cost of diesel has surged 16% this year from an average 1.24 euros ($1.41) per liter to 1.48 euros ($1.69), even hitting 1.53 euros in October, according to UFIP, France's oil industry federation.
The price hike is largely caused by a leap in the wholesale price of oil, with Brent crude oil -- a benchmark for worldwide oil purchases -- increasing by more than 20% in the first half of 2018 from around $60 a barrel to a peak of $86.07 in early October.
Macron has borne the brunt of the demonstrators' anger instead of OPEC for reducing oil production, or the US for imposing tariffs on Iran, which crippled oil exports.
Many protesters are angry with the president for extending the environmental policies that were first implemented by former President François Hollande.

President: Tributes to police
The weekend saw the protests in the French capital descend into violence, with buildings cars set alight, and, authorities say, attacks on citizens.
The city's famed Arc de Triomphe -- a flashpoint in Saturday's violent protests -- was also vandalized, scrawled with slogans in support of the yellow vest movement and others criticizing Macron as the President "of the rich."
Upon his return to Paris from the G20 meeting, Macron immediately visited the war monument to "take stock of the damage" and pay tribute to the tomb of the unknown soldier at its base, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.  He also met with police officers and firefighters who worked to contain the protests.

Macron also held an emergency security meeting with top officials on Sunday. In a written statement he paid tribute to law enforcement and rescue teams who "showed unrelenting bravery throughout the day and evening," according to a release from the French Presidency.
The statement also said that Macron "stressed the importance of judicial follow-up so that none of the acts committed remains unpunished."

French Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet said that the unrest was "absolutely unacceptable," but added that she would not yet recommend announcing a state of emergency, stressing that there were "alternatives," without elaborating what else was being considered.
"When there are not only defacements that are absolutely unacceptable in our republic, I think of what happened at the Arc de Triomphe, when there are fires, not only cars -- there have been 55 vehicles burned but also buildings that have been burned, when there are attacks on people, including I think a rape, these are elements that cannot be acceptable in our republic."
Workers clean grafitti off the Arc de Triomphe.
Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz alleged that among the protesters were people from across the country who had descended upon Paris with the express intent of causing trouble. He added that authorities would crack down hardest on those who had joined the street demonstrations explicitly carry out violent acts.
"There are varied profiles but there are definitely profiles of people who have come from the provinces all over France, obviously to carry out acts of violence, and it is to these people that the criminal response I will say will be the strongest."

Consider our tumultuous times: The President of the United States predicting a 
popular revolt
 if he's impeached; the United Kingdom and its government teetering on the edge of an uncertain future; the 
streets of Paris
 ablaze with the biggest demonstrations in decades; the mighty German Chancellor easing herself 
out of power
 after her party
 lost ground
 to an emerging far-right party; Eastern European leaders taking democracy apart 
brick by brick
.
Is it a sheer coincidence that the turbulence buffeting strong democracies is occurring simultaneously? Clearly not.
Frida Ghitis
It used to be an article of faith in democratic countries that "all politics are local," as the legendary House Speaker Tip O'Neill 
explained
, but the catchy proverb misses much of what is happening today. An old boss once told me never to believe in coincidences. Instead, he instructed me, look for cause and effect.
However unique each country's circumstances, there is no escaping that democracies, particularly but not exclusively those in the West, are facing a historic crisis. The Brexit quagmire in the United Kingdom, the turmoil roiling France, and the political storm clouds gathering over the United States, along with political disruptions in numerous other countries are fueled by many of the same factors.
Importantly, their fates are deeply intertwined -- how each plays out will affect the others.  That is particularly true of what happens in the coming months in the United States, whose democracy attracts more attention than any other on Earth, and often sets the tone for other nations.
Read More
It may sound melodramatic, but the  future of democracy hangs in the balance as these parallel dramas unfold. 
Sure, every country has its own traits and its own circumstances. Only the United States has Trump, no matter how many 
other politicians
 around the world 
are branded 
as "The Trump of (fill in the blank)." There's no other Merkel, no other Macron, no other Brexit. But many of the events and forces that brought each country to its current crossroads are common to all.
America is paying an awful price for Trump
What we see today is partly the aftereffects of the global Great Recession, the economic unraveling that began a decade ago and left deep scars. The inability of traditional leaders to prevent economic calamity, and the impunity for those who caused it, created politically charged resentment, disenchantment, and a lack of trust in the system and its traditional leaders. That was one major event that opened people's minds to theories and people they might have dismissed before. But that was just the start.
Even before the global economic disaster started to unwind, a war began in Syria. It might have seemed distant -- one reason why Western leaders 
mishandled 
it. Obviously, the greatest suffering fell upon Syrians, but the consequences reverberate in today's events in the West.
The Syrian war brought to Western homes emotionally incandescent images of two separate tragedies. Millions of civilians 
fled the carnage
, making their way to the West over harsh seas and craggy land. And just as people watching the images pondered how to help, one of the most brutal terrorist organizations in recent memory started 
slaughtering people
 on camera, beheading journalists, and then taking its bloodcurdling show on the road to the streets of
 Paris
, 
Barcelona
Brussels
London
 and elsewhere. That made it easy for opportunists with a political agenda to blur the distinction between innocent refugees and terrorists to exploit the situation.
By then, mistrust in the powerful had become even more toxic, with news of global corruption spreading after the release of the 
Panama Papers
 and 
other investigations
Macron's top-down approach to fighting climate change serves as a cautionary tale
It was an explosive combination. The public, already angry at traditional leaders after the economic crisis, was now frightened by outsiders. As each country decided how to respond to the massive humanitarian crisis building at its borders, internal divisions started growing.
For demagogues, there could be no more fertile ground. But ethno-nationalist politicians had even more help from Russian President Vladimir Putin and his army of paid cyberactivists.
Putin's keyboard brigades jumped into the fray, doing all they could to inflame resentments and sow distrust not only in politicians but in the political system itself. They deliberately worked to 
trigger clashes
 among those with different political ideas.
In the United States, intelligence agencies 
concluded
 that Putin's interference in the 2016 election aimed to "undermine public faith in the US democratic process," and "help [Donald] Trump's election chances." By facilitating Trump's election, Russia contributed to one of the most pernicious threats to liberal democracy today, a US President 
who continuously
 embraces dictators and undercuts its most fundamental principles: a
 free press
, individual equality and the
 rule of law
After Trump's victory, Russia tried to replicate its US campaign in 
other countries
, attempting electoral cyberattacks in 
France
, Germany and elsewhere.
The non-Brits guide to Brexit (because it affects you too)
According to
 Bloomberg
,
 AFP
 and others, the French government is investigating possible Russian efforts to stoke the "yellow vest" protests, which was sparked by increases in fuel prices and quickly snowballed into a widespread anti-government movement. And according to Western researchers and information from Twitter, which 
showed activities
 of Russian trolls, Russia secretly campaigned to persuade British voters to support Brexit, a vote to leave the European Union, which is proving enormously damaging, and which many now regret. 
According 
to testimony
 before the US  Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Russia supported Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany, not only through logistical assistance, but more formidably through Kremlin-crafted "
influence operations
," seeking to destabilize the Western alliance's largest European member at a time when Trump was already casting doubt on America's commitment to its allies.  All these factors now fueling the crisis of democracy were supercharged by social media, an echo chamber that can magnify discontent so loudly that it can block out reasonable debate.

In countries with shallower democratic roots, democracy is quickly giving ground. In  Hungary and Poland, voters motivated by the same factors elected authoritarian leaders who are
 steadily crushing
 an independent judiciary, and far from US and European shores, 
authoritarian leaders 
are making strides.
In 2019, the struggle to save democracy will face its key tests. Much will depend on what happens in the United States, whose election of Trump deprived democratic forces around the world of their most reliable advocate. The campaign will be waged by citizens, journalists, prosecutors and politicians. I remain optimistic that democracy will survive, but as the turmoil continues in so many countries, in the heart of the democratic West, I have no illusions that that outcome is assured.

Every week, I offer a glimpse of the kind of intelligence assessments that are likely to come across the desk of the President of the United States, modeled on the President's Daily Briefing, or PDB, which the director of national intelligence prepares for the President almost daily.
Here's this week's briefing:
The US is focused on reaching a short-term trade deal with Beijing. But China is focused on playing the long game in ways that threaten US national security.
US negotiators are preparing for talks during their 90-day trade truce with China, and this isn't a simple game of Chinese checkers. While alleviating the economic pressures of the trade war at home is a priority, China's President Xi Jinping also wants to extend its reach elsewhere. 
 Sam Vinograd
We appear narrowly focused on selling more soybeans and reducing our trade deficit, but China is not as myopic. It is just as focused on other priorities, many of which impact our own national security. That's why any moves we make against China -- including the arrest of Huawei's CFO Meng Wanzhou -- could be met in a variety of threatening ways.
Read More
Here are several activities that China is already engaged in to advance its strategic interests:
The best in the business
: We've said publicly that China is one of our biggest cyber 
threats
. And since China views cyber operations as a low-cost tool to achieve strategic objectives, it will keep improving its cyber capabilities. While we plan to address cyber theft as part of our trade negotiations (with possible charges against Chinese nationals for 
hacking
), Chinese hackers have penetrated a lot of our public and private places. 
We have not publicly verified reports that it was behind the massive 
Marriott
 data breach. But China has penetrated classified 
security clearance
 information before -- in addition to state-sponsored cyber espionage against the private sector for commercial advantage. 
They've had time to refine their skills since agreeing to stop this in 
2015
. Increased Chinese economic uncertainty and any anger directed at us for trade war intransigence could lead to increased efforts to ramp up cyber espionage that would jeopardize sensitive information and expose China's skills, and our own insecurities, in cyberspace. 
Arresting Huawei exec is a case of spectacularly bad timing
Cementing the new North Korean normal
: You are preparing for a second summit with Kim Jong Un while China seeks to continue Kim's steady march toward normalcy on the world stage. Now that the Chinese have 
less reason to fear a US military strike against North Korea
, they are less concerned with placating the White House and can double down on making North Korea great again. Xi probably figures that the more integrated Kim is with the world, the less likely the US is to revert to fire and fury rhetoric.
Plus, if Kim behaves better, you could eventually lift some sanctions which would benefit China. China is North Korea's largest trading partner and wants sanctions lifted so it can resume exporting at pre-sanctions levels.
Xi's also reportedly thinking about a
 trip to North Korea
 soon. With or without a visit, Xi's aware of your perception that he has some control over Kim and could try to exploit any of his leverage over Kim -- including trying to pull Kim further away from your stated goal of denuclearization -- if trade talks falter. 
America is paying an awful price for Trump
Relationship advice
: Relationships with China are complicated, and if you get into a fight, China has a lot of tools to make your life uncomfortable. Take Taiwan as an example. The island nation has been at odds with China for decades and suffered the economic, security and diplomatic consequences. Because Taiwan's recent election resulted in a victory for the pro-Chinese Kuomintang Party, it's likely that China will step up its efforts to bolster pro-China sentiment in Taiwan while trying to peel away more of its allies, business contacts and global support system. 
The Chinese also know Taiwan's security is a 
core focus
 for the US. Any increased Chinese pressure on Taiwan could be a double win for Xi because it serves China's interest in controlling Taiwan while concurrently hurting our focus on opposing further Chinese gains, especially while they try to extend their sphere of influence 
elsewhere in the region
.
Buying new friends:
 While we criticize "
questionably run
" Third World countries, China is devoting a lot of time and money-making inroads around the world. Xi has visited Africa four times and just hosted 
another economic cooperation summit 
where he emphasized the shared future of Africa and China and announced $60 billion in investments in Africa. While China continues investing in Africa and around the world (Xi's multibillion-dollar 
One Belt, One Road
 initiative covers more than 60 countries) expect Xi also to continue his debt diplomacy efforts so more countries are tied to, and reliant on, China going forward.
UN humanitarian chief: It's not too late to save Yemen from apocalypse
But US policymakers can act to protect national security interests. They can do so by making clear to Chinese counterparts that regardless of what happens on trade, we're going full steam ahead when it comes to countering Chinese aggression on every other front. This could include indicting Chinese hackers to declaring our ongoing commitment to defending Taiwan.
We're also assessing evolving developments on the following issues:
Dancing to the White House shuffle
: The high pace of administration staff changes may be viewed as exploitable opportunities for our enemies. As part of their mission to undermine our credibility, you should expect them to use information warfare to exploit perceptions of US disorganization during these transitions. 
Yellow Vests and friends
: Russia likes to stoke protests and create discord. They've supported divisive groups on all sides of controversial issues in the US. And there are indications that Russia got involved in the Yellow Vest protests in France, at least
 via social media
, where we've seen Russian accounts spread inflammatory content. If protests continue, we should expect 
Russia to keep amplifying them
 as part of their overall mission of sowing divisions and undermining the democratic order.
Keep talking about Yemen:
 While Congress continues its scrutiny of Saudi support for the war in Yemen, the "positive spirit" at 
ongoing peace talks
 could be a sign of progress toward at least mitigating some of the violence and ongoing humanitarian disaster. We assess that ongoing congressional scrutiny of Saudi Arabia could, in fact, lead the Kingdom to make some concessions in the talks because of a desire to try to improve its public image, even slightly.

The chicken or the egg:
 Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said
 last week
 that if sanctions continue, Iran's abilities "in fighting drugs and terrorism in their origins is undermined" and "you will not be able to survive the debris of drugs, refugees and bombs and assassination." Rouhani has it backwards -- sanctions don't beget terrorism. Rather, Iran is currently the
 largest state sponsor of terror
 in the world and is 
sanctioned
 because of its support for terrorism, among other things. 
Still, Rouhani just blamed sanctions for the country's 
inability to control future attacks
 on the West. His fear-mongering statements are propaganda (he won't ever miss a chance to blame others for his own shortcomings) but also a clear threat. You should expect the Iranians to ramp up their warnings about the consequences of more sanctions as the sanctions start to really bite. We will also monitor whether there are increased threats -- terrorist and otherwise -- as Iran tries to push back on the US.

The body of a woman has been found buried under rubble following an explosion caused by a gas leak in central Paris, bringing the death toll of the disaster to four, a spokesman for the Paris prosecutor told CNN on Sunday.
The blast, which occurred at a bakery at 9 a.m. local time on Saturday, killed two firefighters who were responding reports of the leak, while a Spanish national died hours after the incident in hospital. 
"Profound sadness. Standing by the families of victims. The nation shares in their pain," French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner tweeted after the explosion, adding that 10 people, including a firefighter, were seriously injured and a further 37 were "in a state of relative emergency."
Pictures from the scene, on Rue de Trevise in the 9th arrondissement of the French capital, showed smashed windows and scattered debris across the street, as fire crews evacuated people from apartments above the bakery.
Firefighters intervene after the explosion of a bakery on the corner of the streets Saint-Cecile and Rue de Trevise in central Paris on January 12, 2019.
"At this stage, we can tell the origin of the explosion is accidental, a gas leak, but we should remain prudent as an ongoing investigation will determine the causes of this," Heitz said.

More than 200 firefighters were responding to the incident, Castaner wrote. "My first thoughts go to those injured and their loved ones," he added.
The explosion occurred hours before gilets jaunes (yellow vest) protesters 
marched through the city for a ninth successive weekend
, near the street on which the blast occurred. 
Police had earlier advised the public to stay away from the area, and to make space for emergency vehicles.
